    The Hague, 29 September 1872.
    
    My dear Theo,
Thanks for your letter, I was glad to hear that you got back safely. I missed you the first few days, and it was strange for me not to find you when I came home in the afternoon.
We spent some pleasant days together, and actually did go for some walks and see a thing or two whenever we had the chance.
    What terrible weather, you must feel anxious on your walks to Oisterwijk.1 Yesterday there were trotting races on the occasion of the exhibition,2 but the illumination and fireworks were postponed because of the bad weather,3 so it’s just as well you didn’t stay to see them. Regards from the Haanebeeks4 and the Rooses.5 Ever,

Your loving
Vincent

The Hague, 13 December 1872.

My dear Theo,
That was good news that I just read in Pa’s letter.1 My hearty congratulations.
I don’t doubt that it will give you pleasure, it’s such a fine firm.
It will be a big change for you.
I’m so glad that both of us are now in the same line of business, and in the same firm;2 we must correspond often. 
&nbsp;1v:2 
I hope so much to see you before you leave, we’ll have a lot to talk about.
I believe that Brussels is a very pleasant city, though it will seem strange at first.
At all events, write to me soon.
And now adieu, these are only a few words written in haste, but I just had to tell you how very glad I was.
I wish you well, and believe me ever,

Your loving brother
Vincent

I pity your having to go to Oisterwijk every day in this beastly weather. Regards from the Rooses.

The Hague, January 1873

My dear Theo,
I heard from home that you arrived safe and sound in Brussels, and that your first impression was good.
I understand completely how strange it will be in the beginning, but be of good heart, you’ll surely succeed. You must write to me soon about how things are going and how your boarding-house suits you.1
I hope that the latter will be all right. Pa wrote that you’re good friends with Schmidt.2 Bravo, I think he’s a fine fellow, and one who’ll be sure to show you the ropes.
&nbsp;1v:2 
How pleasant those days at Christmas were, I think of them so often; they’ll also long be remembered by you, as they were also your last days at home. You must write to me in particular about what kind of paintings you see and what you find beautiful.
I’m busy now at the beginning of the year. My new year began well, I was given a monthly rise of 10 guilders, so I now earn 50 guilders a month, and on  of that I received a 50-guilder bonus.3 Isn’t that wonderful? I now hope to be entirely self-supporting. 
&nbsp;1v:3 
I’m really very happy that you’re also part of this firm. It’s such a fine firm, the longer one is part of it the more enthusiastic one becomes.
The beginning is perhaps more difficult than in other jobs, but keep your chin up and you’ll get along.
Do ask Schmidt what the ‘Album Corot. lithographies par Emile Vernier’4 costs. We’ve been asked about it in the shop, and I know it’s in stock in Brussels.
The next time I write I’ll send you my portrait;5 I had it taken last Sunday.
Have you been to the Palais Ducal yet?6 
&nbsp;1r:4  Do go when you get the chance.
How is Uncle Hein? I feel so sorry for him, and hope so much that he’ll get better.7 Give him and Aunt8 my warm regards.
Did Uncle Cent9 stop off at Brussels?
Well, old chap, keep well, all your acquaintances here send their regards and hope things will go well for you. Bid good-day to Schmidt and Eduard10 for me, and let me hear from you soon.
Adieu

Your loving brother

My dear Theo,
It’s good that you answered me so quickly. I’m glad that things are to your liking and that you’ve been lucky with your boarding-house. Be of good heart if things sometimes get difficult, everything will come right later on, and no one can do what he really wants in the beginning.
How sorry I am about Uncle Hein. I sincerely hope he’ll get better, but Theo, I fear he won’t. Last summer he was still 
&nbsp;1v:2  so full of ambition, and had so many plans and told me that business was going so well. It is indeed sad.1
    Last Sunday I was at  Uncle Cor’s2 and had a very pleasant day there and, as you can well imagine, saw many beautiful things. As you know, Uncle has just been to Paris and has brought home splendid paintings and drawings. I stayed in Amsterdam on Monday morning and went to the museums again. Did you know that a large, new building will take the place of the Trippenhuis in Amsterdam? That’s fine with me; the Trippenhuis is too small, and many paintings hang in such a way that one can’t see them properly.3 
&nbsp;1v:3 
How I’d like to see that painting by Cluysenaar.4 I’ve seen only a few of his paintings,5 and those I find very beautiful. Write and tell me whether that other painting is by Alfred Stevens,6 or otherwise what his Christian name is. I know the photo of the Rotta,7 and even saw the painting at the Brussels exhibition.8 Do keep me constantly informed about whatever you see, that always gives me pleasure. The album whose title you gave me isn’t the one I meant, which contains only lithographs after Corot.9 Thanks anyway for taking the trouble.
I expect a letter from Anna soon.10 She’s rather lazy about writing these days. You ought to surprise her with a letter sometime, that would give her so much pleasure. You must be very busy, but that’s a good thing. 
&nbsp;1r:4 
It’s cold here, and people are already skating on the flooded fields. I go walking as much as I can. I’m curious to know whether you’ll find an opportunity to go skating. Herewith my portrait, but don’t say anything about it when you write home. As you know, it’s for Pa’s birthday,11 on which I congratulate you ahead of the event.
My warm regards to Uncle and Aunt,12 also to Mr Schmidt and Eduard.13

Ever your loving brother

The Hague, 17 March 1873

My dear Theo,
It’s time you heard from me again, and I’m also longing to hear how you are and how Uncle Hein is doing, so I hope you’ll write to me when you can find the time.
You’ll have heard that I’m going to London, and probably very soon.1 I do hope we’ll be able to see each other before then.
I’ll go to Helvoirt at Easter2 if I possibly can, but it will depend on the nouveautés that Iterson takes along on his trip.3 I won’t be able to leave 
&nbsp;1v:2  until he gets back.
Life in L. will be very different for me, for I’ll probably have to live alone in lodgings, and will therefore have to deal with many things that I needn’t trouble myself with now.
I’m looking forward to seeing L. very much, as you can imagine, and yet I’m sorry to have to leave this place. I’m only just noticing how attached I am to The Hague, now that it’s been decided I must go away. Still, it can’t be helped, and I intend not to take things too hard. I think it’s wonderful for my English, which I understand well, though I don’t speak it nearly as well as I’d like.4 
&nbsp;1v:3 
I heard from Anna that you had your portrait taken.5 If you can spare another, I commend myself.
How is Uncle Hein? Certainly no better, and how is Aunt doing? Can Uncle keep himself occupied, and is he in a lot of pain? Give them my warm regards, I think of them so often.
How is business with you? It must be busy, as it is here. You probably know your way around by now.
How is your boarding-house? Is it still to your liking? That’s important. Above all, you must write more about the kind of things you see. Sunday a fortnight ago  I was in Amsterdam to see an exhibition of the paintings going to Vienna from here.6 It was very interesting, and I’m curious 
&nbsp;1r:4  as to the impression the Dutch will make in Vienna. I’m very curious about the English painters, we see so little of them, because almost everything stays in England.
Goupil has no gallery in London; they only supply the trade.7
Uncle Cent is coming here at the end of the month, I’m longing to hear more from him.
The Haanebeeks and Aunt Fie8 ask after you constantly, and send you their regards.
What wonderful weather we’ve been having, I’m taking advantage of it as much as I can. Last Sunday I went rowing with Willem.9 How much I’d have liked to stay here this summer, but we must take things as they come. And now, adieu, I wish you well, and write to me. Bid good-day to Uncle and Aunt, Schmidt and Eduard from me.10 As to Easter, I’m just hoping. Ever,

Your loving brother
Vincent

Mr and Mrs Roos and Willem also send you their regards.

I just received your letter, for which I thank you. I’m very pleased with the portrait, it turned out well. If I hear anything more about my trip to Helvoirt I’ll write to you immediately. It would be nice if we could arrive on the same day. Adieu.

Theo, I must again recommend that you start smoking a pipe. It does you a lot of good when you’re out of spirits, as I quite often am nowadays.

My dear Theo,
Would you mind checking whether a painting by Schotel is still in Brussels?
    It was sent from here on consignment on 6 May 1870, but perhaps Uncle has already sent it back to Paris.
If that isn’t the case, however, see that it’s sent here immediately. 
&nbsp;1v:2  We have every chance of selling it, but time is of the essence.1
I saw it last summer in your gallery,2 and imagine it’s probably still there.
Bid good-day to Uncle and Aunt3 and Mr Schmidt and Eduard for me.4
You’ll have received my letter by now.5 Adieu, I wish you well.

My dear Theo,
You mustn’t take it amiss, old chap, that I didn’t remember your birthday.1 Many congratulations; I hope that things will continue to go well for you this year, and that you’ll take more and more pleasure in your work. 
&nbsp;1v:2 
My time is drawing to a close. On Saturday I’ll go home and take my leave, and then on Sunday on to Paris. I’m afraid it’ll end up being Monday, however, and that on Sunday I’ll still be in Helvoirt. I hope I’ll be able to write to you in time about when I’ll be passing through Brussels, but it’s quite possible that I won’t be able to, as I don’t yet know for sure when I have to be in Paris at the latest. 
&nbsp;1v:3 
How are Uncle and Aunt? Have they moved yet?2 Be sure to write to me soon about that, I’ll give you my address below. I’m writing in haste, as you can imagine I’m busy. Adieu, I wish you well. Give my warm regards to Uncle and Aunt, also to Mr Schmidt and Eduard.3 Ever your loving brother

Before I forget, yesterday 
&nbsp;1v:2  I showed your portrait to Mrs Tersteeg,2 and she would like very much to have one. Would you have a chance to get another one and send it to me?
If you can’t do it now, try to think of it some other time.

London, 13 June 1873.

My dear Theo,
You’re probably longing to hear from me,1 so I don’t want to keep you waiting for a letter any longer.
I heard from home that you’re now staying with Mr Schmidt, and that Pa has been to see you. I sincerely hope that this will be more to your liking than your previous boarding-house, and don’t doubt that it will be.2 Write to me soon, I’m longing to hear from you, and tell me how you’re 
&nbsp;1v:2  spending your days at present, &amp;c. Write to me especially about the paintings you’ve seen recently, and also whether anything new has been published in the way of etchings or lithographs. You must keep me well informed about this, because here I don’t see much in that genre, as the firm here is just a stockroom.3
I’m very well, considering the circumstances.
I’ve come by a boarding-house that suits me very well for the present.4 There are also three Germans in the house who really love music and play piano and sing themselves, which makes the evenings 
&nbsp;1v:3  very pleasant indeed. I’m not as busy here as I was in The Hague, as I only have to be in the office from 9 in the morning until 6 in the evening, and on Saturdays I’m finished by 4 o’clock. I live in one of the suburbs of London, where it’s comparatively quiet. It’s a bit like Tilburg5 or some such place.
I spent some very pleasant days in Paris and, as you can imagine, very much enjoyed all the beautiful things I saw at the exhibition6 and in the Louvre and the Luxembourg.7 The Paris branch is splendid, and much larger than I’d imagined. Especially the Place de l’Opéra.8
Life here is very expensive. I pay 
&nbsp;1r:4  18 shillings a week for my lodgings, not including the washing, and then I still have to eat in town.9
Last Sunday I went on an outing with Mr Obach, my superior,10 to Box Hill, which is a high hill (some 6 hours from L.),11 partly of chalk and covered with box trees, and on one side a wood of tall oak trees. The countryside here is magnificent, completely different from Holland or Belgium. Everywhere one sees splendid parks with tall trees and shrubs, where one is allowed to walk. During the Whitsun holiday12 I also took a nice trip with those Germans, but those gentlemen spend a great deal of money and I shan’t go out with them any more.
I was glad to hear from Pa that Uncle H. is reasonably well. Would you give my warm regards to him and Aunt13 and give them news of me? Bid good-day to Mr Schmidt and Eduard from me,14 and write to me soon. Adieu, I wish you well.

London, 2 July 1873

My dear friends,1
I wanted to write to you even earlier, and now I don’t want to put it off any longer.
How are you? I’ve heard that you have made your house as neat as a new pin and that you’re doing well.2 I commend myself expressly to hear something from you, should you have a moment at your disposal.
I’m doing well here; I’m seeing a lot of new and beautiful things, and have had luck in finding a good boarding-house, so that I already feel relatively 
&nbsp;1v:2  settled here.3
Still, I haven’t forgotten The Hague and should very, very much like to spend another evening in the Poten,4 and also look in on you.
This branch is just a stockroom and is therefore completely different from working in The Hague, though I’m sure I’ll get used to it.
I’m already finished with my work at 6 o’clock, so I still have a fair amount of time for myself, which I spend very pleasantly walking, reading and writing letters.
The neighbourhood where I live is very pretty, and so peaceful and convivial that one almost forgets one is in London.
In front of every house is a small garden with flowers or a couple of trees, and many houses are built very tastefully in a sort of Gothic style.
Still, I have to walk for more than 
&nbsp;1v:3  half an hour to reach the countryside.
We have a piano in the drawing room, and there are also three Germans living here who really love music, which is most agreeable.
One of the nicest things I’ve seen here is Rotten Row in Hyde Park, which is a long, broad avenue where hundreds of ladies and gentlemen go riding.
In every part of the city there are splendid parks with a wealth of flowers such as I’ve seen nowhere else.
I enclose a copy of a poem by Van Beers,5 which you may not know.
Our Elisabeth6 copied it out for me on my last evening in Helvoirt,7 because she knew how much I liked it.
It’s Brabant to a T.8 I thought you’d enjoy reading it, so I’ve copied it out for you. 
&nbsp;1r:4 
It was very thoughtful of your sister Marie to send me an announcement. I’m longing to hear about the wedding, on which I congratulate you as well.9
Would you be so kind as to send me a list of your birthdays when you get the opportunity? I had one which I’ve lost.
And now, regards, bid everyone in the Poten good-day from me, and I wish you all well. Excuse the poor handwriting, it’s already late and time to go to bed.
Good-night.

Vincent

&nbsp;2r:5 
The evening hour10

Slowly the toll of the angelus-bell resounded o’er the fields,
As they blissfully bathed in the gold of the evening sun.
O solemn, moving moment! When every mother in the village suddenly
Ss the whirring of the wheel to bless herself with the sign of the cross;

While in the field the farmer reins in his steaming horses,
And, behind the plough, bares his head to murmur an Ave.
O solemn, moving moment! When the bell that proclaims far and wide
The end of the day’s work makes those powerful, dripping heads
Bow down for Him who causes the sweat in the furrow to thrive.

For the artist, too, on the slope of yon shady hill,
Absorbed in his painting from the earliest morning,
The angelus now gave the sign to retreat. Slowly he wiped
His brush and palette, which he stowed with his canvas in the valise,
Folded his camp-stool and dreamily descended the path
That leads, gently winding, through the flowery dale to the village.

Yet how oft, before reaching the foot of the hill, did he
Stand admiringly still, to imprint on his mind once again
The refreshing scene down below, unfolding before his eyes.

Just before him lay the village, with a hill to north and to south,
Between whose crests the sun, inflamed and sinking in the west,
Let flow the whole wealth of its colours and up-conjured glory.
The bell, in the grey tower entwined with black-green ivy,
Was now silent. Hanging motionless on high were the brown
Sails of the windmill; the leaves stood still and above the huts
Blue clouds of peat-smoke ascended so straight from the chimneys
That they, too, seemed to hang motionless in the shimmering air.
’Twas as though this village, this field, those hills, as though everything,
Before wrapping itself in a cloak of evening dew to sleep
Beneath the sun’s parting kiss, silently and gratefully
Recalled once more the peace and plenty it had again savoured.


&nbsp;2v:6 
Soon, though, this silence was gently disturbed by the sweet sounds
Of the evening. In the distance, from a hollow in the hill echoed
Lingeringly the sound of the cow-horn, calling the cattle.
And at this sign from their herdsman there soon appeared in the furrowed,
Sandy mountain road the whole of a colourful herd of cows.
Cracking and smacking, the lad’s lash drove them forward,
While they, as if by turns, their necks outstretched, with friendly lowing
Greeted from afar the cow-shed where the milkmaid
Waited for them each evening to ease their taut udders.
Thus on the paths running out from the village like spokes
From an axle, there slowly came movement and life.
Here, ’twas a farmer, dragging homeward a harrow or plough
On a sledge, whistling a tune and riding beside on his bay;
There, a blushing lass, on her head a lock of sweet clover
Laced with daisies and poppies, called from afar to the others,
Kindly and gaily at once, her clear-toned ‘good evening’.
Further... But on the same track where the painter’s path
Led, he suddenly heard peals of joyous laughter.
Rocking from side to side, a wagon, nearly toppling
Under its load of fresh-harvested buckwheat, came rumbling closer,
Both horse and burden adorned with fluttering ribbons and greenery.
Children, all with wreaths of flowers on their little flaxen heads,
Were seated on top, happily waving branches of alder,
Or scattering flowers and leaves, which rained down on all sides,
While round the wagon a troop of country lads and lasses
Skipped and sang enough to startle the whole drowsy plain.

Quietly smiling, the Painter, from behind the thicket,
Watched as the revellers slowly wound their way down the rutted road.
‘Aye’, he thus mumbled, ‘Aye, the Lord must think it
A happy sound, the jubilance with which these hearts 
&nbsp;2r:7 
So simply pour forth their thanks as they gather the last
Fruits, which He yearly lets grow fully ripe from their toil.
Yea, for the purest prayer of simplicity and innocence is joy!’

And thus contemplating the calm, deep delight upon which the soul
Feasts in the fields; or with his artist’s mind reconstructing
In silent rapture the glorious scene of a moment ago,
He found he had sauntered, unnoticing, into the village.

Already the purple and yellow had faded to grey in the west,
And in the east there had risen close by the little church the full
Copper-coloured disc of the moon, in mist enshrouded,
When he entered The Swan, the inn where he boarded.

London, 20 July 1873

My dear Theo,
Thanks for your letter, which gave me a great deal of pleasure. I’m glad you’re well and that living at Mr Schmidt’s is still to your liking. Mr Obach was pleased to make your acquaintance.1 I hope that in future we’ll do a lot of business with you. That painting by Linder2 is very beautiful.
As to the photogravure, I know more or less how they’re made, though I haven’t seen it, and it isn’t clear enough to me to explain it.3
English art didn’t appeal to me much at first, one has to get used to it. There are some good painters here, though, including Millais, who made ‘The Huguenot’, Ophelia, &amp;c., engravings of which you probably know,4 they’re very beautiful. Then Boughton, of whom you know the ‘Puritans going to church’ 
&nbsp;1v:2  in our Galerie photographique.5 I’ve seen very beautiful things by him. Moreover, among the old painters, Constable, a landscape painter who lived around 30 years ago, whose work is splendid, something like Diaz and Daubigny. And Reynolds and Gainsborough, who mostly painted very, very beautiful portraits of women, and then Turner, after whom you’ll probably have seen engravings.6
Several good French painters live here, including Tissot, after whom there are various photos in our Galerie photographique,7 Otto Weber and Heilbuth. The latter is currently making dazzlingly beautiful paintings in the style of the one by Linder.
Be sure, when you get the chance, to write and tell me whether there are photographs after Wauters, besides Hugo van der Goes and Mary of Burgundy,8 and whether you also know photographs of paintings by Lagye and De Braekeleer. 
    &nbsp;1v:3  It’s not the elder De Braekeleer I mean but, I believe, a son of his, who had 3 splendid paintings at the last exhibition in Brussels, titled ‘Antwerp’, ‘The school’ and ‘The atlas’.9
Things are going well for me here. I go walking a lot. Here where I live it’s a quiet, convivial, nice-looking neighbourhood, in this I’ve really been fortunate. And yet I sometimes think back with nostalgia to the wonderful Sundays in Scheveningen10 and so on, but never mind that.
You’ll surely have heard that Anna is at home and not well.11 It’s a bad start to her holiday, but let’s hope she’s better by now.
Thanks for what you wrote to me about paintings. Be sure to write and tell me if you ever see anything by Lagye, De Braekeleer, Wauters, Maris,12 Tissot, George Saal, Jundt, Ziem, Mauve, who are painters I like very much, and by whom you’ll probably 
&nbsp;1r:4  see something now and then.
Herewith a copy of that poem about that painter ‘who entered The Swan, the inn where he boarded’,13 which you no doubt remember. It’s Brabant to a T, and I’m so fond of it. Lies copied it out for me on my last evening at home.14 How much I’d like to have you here, what pleasant days we spent together in The Hague. I still think so often of our walk on Rijswijkseweg, where we drank milk at the mill after the rain.15 If those paintings we have from you are to be sent back, I’ll send you a portrait of that mill by Weissenbruch.16 Perhaps you remember, ‘the merry tune’ is his nickname, ‘I say, superrrb’.17 That Rijswijkseweg holds memories for me which are perhaps the most delightful I have. Perhaps we’ll speak of it again sometime when we meet.
And now, old chap, I wish you well, think of me from time to time and write to me soon. It’s so refreshing when I receive a letter.

Vincent

My regards to Mr Schmidt and Eduard.18 How are Uncle Hein and Aunt? Write to me about them, do you go there often? Give them my warm regards.

London, 7 August 1873

My dear friends,
It was a very pleasant surprise for me to receive Caroline’s letter. Thank you.
I sincerely hope that she’s now completely better; fortunately, it’s past. When you write again sometime I must hear more about that last piece you made.1 I was truly astounded by it; for 10 people, that’s surely the biggest you’ve done.
The last few days I’ve enjoyed reading the poems of John Keats; he’s a poet who isn’t very well known in Holland, I believe. He’s the 
&nbsp;1v:2  favourite of the painters here, and that’s how I came to be reading him.2 Herewith something by him.3 His most famous piece is ‘St Agnes’ eve’, but it’s rather too long to copy out.4
I haven’t yet been to the Crystal Palace and the Tower, nor to Tussaud’s;5 I’m not at all in a hurry to go and see everything. For the time being I have enough with the museums, parks, &amp;c., which attract me more.
I had a nice day last Monday. The first Monday in Aug. is a holiday here.6 I went with one of the Germans to Dulwich, an hour and a half outside L., to see the museum there,7 and afterwards we walked to a village about an hour further on. The countryside here is so beautiful; many people who have their business in L. live in some village or other outside L. and come to the city every day by train. Perhaps I’ll 
&nbsp;1v:3  soon be doing that as well, if I can find a cheap room somewhere. But I find moving so terrible that I’ll stay here as long as possible, though things aren’t as nice here as they seemed at first. Perhaps this is my fault, so I’ll wait a little longer.
I’m sorry that my letter isn’t as I’d wish it to be, I’m writing in haste. But I wanted to congratulate you on Willem’s birthday8 and wish you many happy returns.
It gave me a great deal of pleasure to hear that you had renewed your acquaintance with the Tersteeg family. I had long been hoping that you would, for your sake.
Write to me when you get the chance and tell me which photographs you’ve received, I’m curious to know. 
&nbsp;1r:4 
I’ve had a letter from Marinus,9 and have understood from it that he’s going to Amsterdam. That will be a big change for him, I hope he’ll do well. I was glad he wrote to me.
A day or two ago I had a visit from a brother of Iterson who lives here,10 and so had the first opportunity of speaking Dutch since May. We live a long way from each other, which I very much regret. And now I bid you good-day, I wish you well. Many regards to everyone in the Poten.11 I wish you well,

Yours truly,
Vincent

Cheer me up soon with a letter if you can find the time.


&nbsp;2r:5 
The eve of Saint Mark12
(Unfinished)

Upon a Sabbath day it fell;
Twice holy was the Sabbath bell,
That called the folk to evening prayer;
The city streets were clear and fair
From wholesome drench of April rains;
And, on the western window panes,
The chilly sunset faintly told
Of unmatured green, vallies cold,
Of the green thorny bloomless hedge,
Of rivers new with spring-tide sedge,
Of primroses by shelter’d rills,
Of daisies on the aguish hills.
Twice holy was the Sabbath-bell:
The silent streets were crowded well
With staid and pious companies,
Warm from their fire-side orat’ries;
And moving, with demurest air
To even-song, and vesper prayer.
Each arched porch, and entry low,
Was fill’d with patient folk and slow,
With whispers hush and shuffling feet,
While played the organ, loud and sweet.
The bells had ceased, the prayers begun,
And Bertha had not yet half done
A curious volume, patch’d and torn,
That all day long, from earliest morn,
Had taken captive her two eyes,
Among its golden broideries;
Perplexed her with a thousand things,
The stars of Heaven, and angels’ wings,
Martyrs in a fiery blaze,
Azure saints and silver rays
Moses’ breastplate, and the seven
Candlesticks John saw in Heaven,
The winged lion of Saint Mark,
And the covenantal Ark,
With its many mysteries
Cherubim and golden mice. 
&nbsp;2v:6 
Bertha was a maiden fair,
Dwelling in th’old minster-square;
From her fireside she could see,
Sidelong, its rich antiquity,
Far as the Bishops gardenwall;
Where sycamores and elm trees tall,
Full leaved, the forest had outstript,
By no sharp north wind ever nipt,
So shelter’d by the mighty pile,
Bertha arose and read awhile,
With forehead ’gainst the window pane.
Again she tried and tried again,
Until the dusk eve left her dark
Upon the legend of St Mark.
From plaited lawn-frill, fine and thin,
She lifted up her soft warm chin,
With aching neck and swimming eyes
And dazed with saintly imag’ries.

All was gloom, and silent all
Save now and then the still foot-fall
Of one returning homewards late,
Past the echoing minster-gate.
The clamorous daws, that all the day
Above tree s and towers play,
Pair by pair had gone to rest,
Each in its ancient belfry-nest,
Where asleep they fall betimes
To music and the drowsy chimes.

All was silent, all was gloom,
Abroad and in the homely room:
Down she sat, poor cheated soul!
And struck a lamp from the dismal coal;
Leaned forward, with bright drooping hair,
And slant book, full against the glare.
Her shadow, in uneasy guise,
Hover’d about, a giant size,
On ceiling beam and old oak chair,
The parrot’s cage, and panel square;
And the warm angled winter-screen,
On which were many monsters seen,
Call’d doves of Siam, Lima mice,
And legless birds of Paradise,
Macaw, and tender Av’davat,
And silken-furr’d Angora cat. 
&nbsp;2v:7 
Untired she read, her shadow still
Glower’d about, as it would fill
The room with wildest forms and shades,
As though some ghostly queen of spades
Had come to mock behind her back
And dance, and ruffle her garments black.
Untired she read the legend page,
Of holy Mark, from youth to age,
On land, on sea, in pagan chains,
Rejoicing for his many pains.
Sometimes the learned eremite,
With golden star, or dagger bright,
Referr’d to pious poesies
Written in smallest crow-quill size
Beneath the text; and thus the rhyme
Was parcell’d out from time to time:
................................................................
................................................................
  John Keats (1818)

    The imagination may be compared to Adam’s dream; ‘he awoke and found it truth’.13

Autumn14

Season of mist, and mellow fruitfulness!
Close bosom-friend to the maturing sun;
Conspiring with him how to load and bless
With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eaves run;
To bend with apples the moss’d cottage trees,
And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;
To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells
With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,
And still more, later flowers for the bees,
Until they think warm days will never cease,
For summer has o’erbrimm’d their clammy cells.

Where are the songs of spring? Ay, where are they?
Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,
While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,
And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;
Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn
Among the river sallows, borne aloft.
Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;
And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;
Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft
The redbreast whistles from a garden croft,
And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.top

London, 13 Sept. 1873

My dear Theo,
Writing to Uncle Hein, I’m enclosing a word for you. I’m very curious to hear whether you went to Helvoirt1 on Ma’s birthday and how it was there.
Did you get my letter and the lithograph by Weissenbruch that I put in the crate of paintings?2 Oh, how I’d like to have you here, old chap, to see my new lodgings,3 which you’ll have heard about. I now have a room, as I’ve long been wishing, without sloping beams and without blue wallpaper with a green border. It’s a very diverting household where I am now, in which they run a school for little boys.
Some time ago I spent a Saturday rowing on the Thames with 2 Englishmen. It was glorious.
&nbsp;1v:2 
Yesterday I saw an exhibition of Belgian paintings,4 which included various old acquaintances from the last Brussels Exhibition.5 There were various beautiful things by  A. and Julien de Vriendt,6 Cluysenaar,7 Wouters,8 Coosemans,9 Gabriël,10 De Schampheleer,11 &amp;c.
Have you ever seen anything by Terlinden?12 If you have, be sure to write to me about it.
It was truly refreshing to see those Belgian paintings; the English ones13 are, with few exceptions, very disagreeable and feeble. Some time ago I saw one with a sort of fish or dragon no less than 6 ells long. It was ghastly. And a little man who was going to kill the above-mentioned creature. And all this represented, I believe, ‘the archangel Michael slaying Satan’.14
Adieu, old chap, I wish you well, and write soon.

Vincent

Another English painting is ‘Satan possessing the herd of swine at the Gadarene lake’. It showed some 50 black pigs and piglets, running helter-skelter downhill and tumbling over each other into the sea. It was very edifying. This was, however, a very clever painting by Prinsep.15

I just received your letter. That will be quite a change for you, now that you’re going to The Hague. I bet it’ll cost you dearly to say goodbye to beautiful, convivial Brussels.16 But you’ll get on well in The Hague too. Thanks for writing to me about the paintings. That painting by Millet must have been very rich.17 Adieu, I’ll write again soon.

London, Oct. 1873

Dear Caroline and Willem,
Many thanks for your letter of this morning. It was a wonderful surprise, I’m happy you’re doing so well.
Our Anna has passed her examinations in English and in needlework, you can imagine how delighted she and all of us are.1 Pa and Ma have suggested that she stay at school until next April, and in that case attempt French, but if she’d rather not she needn’t do it. I’d like it so much if something could be found for her here; we’ve talked about this before, as you know.
You already know that Theo is coming to The Hague, I think it a good change for him, even though it will be difficult for him 
&nbsp;1v:2  to leave beautiful, convivial Brussels.
I also received a letter from your Pa2 some time ago and have already answered it, so you’ll probably have heard that things are continuing to go well for me here, and also know a thing or two about my new lodgings.
What you say about winter is quite right, I think so too. I myself almost don’t know which season I like best; I believe all of them, equally well.
It’s striking that the old painters almost never painted the autumn and that the moderns have such a particular preference for it.
Herewith a couple of small photos which I hope will be to your liking. Here there are practically no albums like those we have in Holland, but rather so-
&nbsp;1v:3 called ‘scrapbooks’ in which one puts photographs, as I’ve done in this letter (which explains why we don’t put the photos in mounts here),3 the advantage of which is that one can arrange all shapes and sizes on the same sheet however one wants. I would advise you to buy a kind of writing-book with blank pages and to put these in it, for a start.
‘A baptism’ is after Anker,4 a Swiss, who has painted all manner of subjects, all equally sensitive and intimate.
‘Puritans going to church’ is after Boughton,5 one of the best painters here; an American, he’s very fond of Longfellow, and rightly so. I know 3 paintings by him based on ‘The courtship of Miles Standish’.6 Seeing the paintings prompted me to read Miles Standish and Evangeline7 again, I don’t know why, but I never knew they were as beautiful as I find them now.
‘The good friar’ is after Van Muyden, a Swiss painter,8 having ‘as yet more modesty than talent’.9 
&nbsp;1r:4  Mr Post in The Hague has this painting.10 If you visit our gallery ask to see his (Van Muyden’s) ‘Refectory’.11 There are no more than 4 or 5 copies of this photograph,12 because the negative is broken. Show it to Mr Tersteeg when you have the opportunity.13 ‘The honeymoon’ is after Eugène Feyen,14 one of the few painters who paint intimate modern life as it really is and don’t turn it into fashion plates. I know the photo of ‘The landlady’s daughter’15 and I find it very beautiful. It’s good that you find Bouguereau beautiful. Not everyone is as capable as you are of noticing and feeling good and fine things. And now I’ll s; I’m enclosing another picture of autumn, by Michelet.16
I hope you’ll be able to read this; I just kept on writing without thinking that one should take care to make a letter legible. Adieu, I wish you both the best; many regards to those in the Poten17 and to any other friends you might see.

Vincent.


&nbsp;2r:5 
From here I see a lady,18 I see her walking, pensive, in a garden that is not very big and has lost its flowers quite early, but is sheltered, like the ones one sees behind our cliffs in France or the dunes of Holland. The exotic shrubs have already gone back into the greenhouse. The fallen leaves reveal some statues. A sumptuousness of art, which contrasts slightly with the very simple attire of the lady — modest, grave — the black (or grey) silk of which is barely brightened by a plain lilac ribbon.
Unadorned, this we can say, she is no less elegant. Elegant for her husband and simple for the benefit of the poor. She reaches the end of the avenue, turns. We can see her. But have I not seen her before in the museums of Amsterdam or The Hague? She reminds me of a lady by Philippe de Champaigne (NB in the Louvre), who had found 
&nbsp;2v:6  her way into my heart, so ingenuous, so honest, sufficiently intelligent, yet simple, without the subtlety to extricate herself from the snares of the world. This woman has remained with me for thirty years, obstinately returning to me, worrying me, making me say, ‘But what was she called? What became of her? Did she have a little happiness? And how did she manage to get through life?’ She reminds me of another portrait, a Van Dyck, a poor woman, very pale, unhealthy. The pale satin of her incomparably delicate skin clothes a sickly body, which is beginning to slacken. A great melancholy fills her lovely eyes, the melancholy of old age? Of heartbreaks, of the climate too, perhaps. It is the vague, distant look of someone who has lived within sight of the vast North Sea, the great grey sea, deserted but for the flight of the seagull.

London, 19 Nov. 1873

My dear Theo,
I want to make sure that you hear from me soon after arriving in The Hague.1 I’m longing to hear your first impression of your new position and lodgings.2 I heard about the beautiful souvenir you got from Mr Schmidt, which just shows that you did very well indeed.3 I’m glad that we’re both working for the same firm now. Latterly we’ve had quite a few paintings and drawings and sold a lot of them, but we still have a long way to go, it has to become more solid and lasting and substantial. I believe that there’s still a lot 
&nbsp;1v:2  to do here in England, but it can’t be done all at once, and of course the first thing we need is to have good paintings &amp;c., and that will be quite a feat. Well, we have to see how it goes and do the best we can with the means at our disposal.
How are the nouveautés4 selling in Holland? Here there’s literally almost nothing to be done with the ordinary engravings after Brochart5 &amp;c. The good burin engravings6 sell quite well; among other things we’ve already sold around 20 artist’s proofs of the Venus anadyomene after Ingres.7 But it’s a delight to see how the photos sell, especially the coloured ones,8 and they yield a handsome profit. The Musée Goupil &amp; Cie photos we sell only en papillottes,9 around 100 a day on average. I imagine you’ll like working in the gallery in 
&nbsp;1v:3  The Hague, once you’ve got used to it a little. I don’t doubt that your lodgings at the Rooses’ will be to your liking. You should walk a lot if you can find the time. Bid a very good-day from me to all the Rooses.
You must write and tell me which painters you like best, both the old and the new, you must be sure to do this, I’m curious to know.
You must in any case go to the museum often, it’s good to be acquainted with the old painters, too, and if you get the chance read about art, and especially magazines about art, the Gazette des Beaux-Arts10 &amp;c.
When there’s an opportunity I’ll send you a book by Bürger about the museums of The Hague and Amsterdam;11 when you’ve finished it there will be an opportunity to send it back to me.
Ask Iterson to write to me if he has a moment, and in particular to send me a list of the painters who 
&nbsp;1r:4  were awarded prizes at the Paris exhibition.12 Is Somerwil13 still with the firm, or has he left now that you’re coming?
Things are going all right for me here, I have a nice home, and even though the firm isn’t as exciting as the Hague branch, it’s perhaps good that I’m here, and later on especially, when the trade in paintings becomes a little more important, I’ll possibly be of use. And then, I can’t tell you how interesting it is to see London and the trade and the way of life here, which are so very different from ours.
You’ll have had some pleasant days at home;14 how much I’d like to see them all again too.
Tell everyone who asks after me that I bid them good-day, especially the Tersteegs, Haanebeeks, Aunt Fie,15 Van Stockums, and the Rooses, and give Betsy Tersteeg news of me sometime when she comes downstairs.16 And now, old chap, I wish you well. Write to me soon.

Vincent

Do you have my room at the Rooses’, or the one you slept in last summer?

London, 20 Nov. 1873.

Dearest Caroline,
  I wish you many happy returns;1 it will surely be a festive day, this first birthday in your own house.2 I hope that this will be a very good and happy year for you both.
You’ve received my last letter, I hope. Write soon with news of how everyone is doing. I’m longing 
&nbsp;1v:2  to hear something again.
Have you seen Theo yet? I heard that he arrived in The Hague last Wednesday.
Herewith a small contribution for the album.3
I’m fine, but I’m up to my ears in work, and only have a moment.
Bid good-day to everyone in the Poten;4 how I’d like to look in on you today. I wish you both the best.

Yours truly,
Vincent.

London, January 1874

My dear Theo,
Thanks for writing.
I sincerely wish you a very happy New Year. I know that things are going well for you in the office, because I heard as much from Mr Tersteeg.1 I saw from your letter that you have art in your blood, and that’s a good thing, old chap. I’m glad you like Millet, Jacque, Schreyer, Lambinet, Frans Hals &amp;c., because – as Mauve says2 – ‘that’s it’. Yes, that painting by Millet ‘The evening angelus’,3 ‘that’s it’. That’s rich, that’s poetry. How I’d like to 
&nbsp;1v:2  talk to you about art again, but now we can only write to each other about it often; find things beautiful as much as you can, most people find too little beautiful.
I’m writing below a few names of painters whom I like very much indeed. Scheffer, Delaroche, Hébert, Hamon.4
Leys, Tissot, Lagye, Boughton, Millais, Thijs Maris, Degroux, De Braekeleer Jr.
    Millet, Jules Breton, Feyen-Perrin, Eugène Feyen, Brion, Jundt, George Saal. Israëls, Anker, Knaus, Vautier, Jourdan, Jalabert,5 Antigna, Compte-Calix, Rochussen, Meissonier, Zamacois, Madrazo, Ziem, Boudin, Gérôme, Fromentin, De Tournemine, Pasini. 
        &nbsp;1v:3 
    Decamps, Bonington, Diaz, T. Rousseau, Troyon, Dupré,6 Paul Huet, Corot, Schreyer, Jacque, Otto Weber, Daubigny, Wahlberg, Bernier, Emile Breton, Chenu, César de Cock, Mlle Collart. Bodmer, Koekkoek, Schelfhout, Weissenbruch, and last but not least Maris7 and Mauve.
But I could go on like this for I don’t know how long, and then come all the old ones, and I’m sure I’ve left out some of the best new ones.
Always continue walking a lot and loving nature, for that’s the real way to learn to understand art better and better. Painters understand nature and love it, and teach us to see.
And then, there are painters who make nothing but good things, who cannot make anything bad, 
&nbsp;1r:4  just as there are ordinary people who cannot do anything that isn’t good.
Things are going well for me here, I have a wonderful home and it’s a great pleasure for me to observe London and the English way of life and the English themselves, and I also have nature and art and poetry, and if that isn’t enough, what is?8 Yet I haven’t forgotten Holland, and especially The Hague and Brabant.
We’re busy in the office, we’re occupied with the inventory, which is however drawn up in 5 days, so we have it a little easier than you do in The Hague.
I hope you had a nice Christmas, just as I did.9
Well, old chap, I wish you well and write to me soon; in this letter I’ve written just what popped into my pen, I hope you’ll be able to understand it. Adieu, regards to everyone in the office and anyone else who asks after me, particularly everyone at Aunt Fie’s10 and the Haanebeeks’.

London, 9 February 1874

My dear Caroline,
  I feel the need to write a few words to you.
What happy days those were ‘when we were together’.1 You must know that I haven’t forgotten you, but writing doesn’t come to me as easily as I’d like.
I have a rich life here, ‘having nothing, yet possessing all things’.2 Sometimes I start to believe that I’m gradually beginning to turn into a true cosmopolitan, meaning not a Dutchman, Englishman or Frenchman, but simply a man. 
&nbsp;1v:2  With the world as my mother country, meaning that tiny spot in the world where we’re set down. But we aren’t there yet, but I follow after, if that I may apprehend.3
And as our ideal that which Mauve calls ‘that’s it’.
Old girl, adieu.

Yours truly,
Vincent

A handshake for you and Willem,4 like old times, so that it hurts your fingers.

London, 20 February 1874

My dear Theo,
Thanks for your letter. I don’t need the book yet, but send it back anyway when you’ve had time to read it.1 I haven’t read the book by Van Vloten,2 but I’d like to have it sometime. I’ve read another book on art by V. Vl. and didn’t agree with him completely, and it was really quite scholarly.3 Bürger is simpler, and everything he says is true. I’m glad you went to Amsterdam;4 thank Uncle Cor when you see him for the brochure he sent me.
I’m glad you’re so happy at the Rooses’; as I already asked Anna Carbentus to tell you,5 you’re completely right about pulling the carrot.6 I also agree with you about B.H.,7 but beware of your heart, old chap.
Have you seen Mr Jacobson’s collection8 yet? It’s well worth while, he’ll no doubt ask you to come and see it sometime. Give him my regards, as politely as you can, and tell him that I’m doing well here and am seeing a lot of beautiful things. 
&nbsp;1v:2 
I’m all right,9 I’m busy. Thank Willem10 for his letter and give my regards to everyone at the Rooses’ and Iterson, Jan and Piet,11 and anyone who asks after me. I wish you well.

Dear Caroline and Willem,
My hearty congratulations.1
I imagine you will have been disappointed not to have heard from me sooner, but that’s like me, and you surely know that I mean well. Now you must render good for evil,2 however, and write to me directly about how things are going.
Now I have a piece of news for you; our Anna will perhaps be coming here.3 You can imagine how wonderful that would be for me, but it’s almost too good to be true. Well, we’ll just have to wait and see. If she comes, it will probably be in May, 
&nbsp;1v:2  and perhaps it could be arranged for me to come and fetch her.
I’d like so much to get to know her better than I do, for in the last few years we’ve actually seen very little of each other, and we only half know each other.
I wish you both the best, many regards to everyone in the Poten,4 and if someone or other asks after me. Have you kept up your acquaintance with the Tersteeg family?5

Yours truly,
Vincent

London, 30 March 1874

My dear Theo,
In a letter from Pa and Ma I got a guilder from you to buy a pair of cuff links.1 Many thanks, old chap, but you shouldn’t have done it, you need your money more than I do.
Thanks for your letter of this morning. I was very glad to hear that Mauve is engaged to Jet C.2 That’s wonderful. I’m glad that you’re so well.
It’s good that you’ve read the book by Bürger;3 read about art as much as possible, especially the Gazette des Beaux-Arts &amp;c. 
&nbsp;1v:2 
Above all, be sure to find out as much as possible about paintings. The Apol that we have here now is very beautiful, last year he painted a similar subject and I found it better and fresher than this one.4
I’m glad that you go to Uncle Cor’s occasionally. You see things there that you never find at the gallery in The Hague.
I’m also busy at present and am glad of it, because that’s what I need.
Adieu, old chap, keep your chin up, and I wish you well. Give my regards to Van Iterson.

As regards Anna, I haven’t heard anything more.

London, 30 April 1874

My dear Theo,
Many happy returns of the day.1 Do right and don’t look back,2 and things will turn out well.
I was glad to get your last letter. I sent you a photo a couple of days ago:

Young girl with a sword, Jacquet3

because I thought you’d like to have it.
Van Gorkom’s painting isn’t very dirty.4 (Between you and me, I didn’t see it, but anyway tell him I wrote that it wasn’t very dirty.)
How are Mauve and Jet Carbentus?5 Write to me with news of them.
It’s good that you visit 
&nbsp;1r:2  the Haanebeeks.6
If I come to Holland, I’ll also come to The Hague for a day or two if possible, because The Hague is like a second home to me. (I’ll come and stay with you.)
I’d have liked to go on that walk to De Vink.7 I walk here as much as I can, but I’m very busy. It’s absolutely beautiful here (even though it’s in the city). There are lilacs and hawthorns and laburnums &amp;c. blossoming in all the gardens, and the chestnut trees are magnificent.
If one truly loves nature one finds beauty everywhere. Yet I sometimes yearn so much for Holland, and especially Helvoirt.
I’m doing a lot of gardening and have sown sweet peas, poppies and reseda, now we just have to 
&nbsp;1v:3  wait and see what comes of it.
I enjoy the walk from home to the office and in the evening from the office back home. It takes about three-quarters of an hour.
It’s wonderful to be finished so early here; we close at 6 o’clock and yet we work none the less because of it.
Give my regards to everyone I know at the Tersteegs’, Haanebeeks’ and Carbentuses’, and especially the Rooses’, also everyone at Uncle Pompe’s, because they’re going to Kampen,8 and Mr Bakhuyzen9 &amp;c.
I wish you the best.

Vincent

The apple trees &amp;c. have blossomed beautifully here; it seems to me that everything is earlier here than in Holland. 
&nbsp;1v:4 
As soon as I know something more definite about my going home, I’ll write to you directly. I fear, however, that it will be around 4 weeks or so before it can happen. Write soon.

London, 16 June 1874

My dear Theo,
Thanks for your letter.
I think I’ll be leaving here on Thursday, 25 or Saturday, 27 June, if nothing unforeseen happens.1 I’m longing so much to see everyone and Holland. I’m also looking forward to having a good talk with you about art, start thinking about any questions you might want to put to me.
We have many beautiful things here, including a spirited painting by Jacquet, and a beautiful Boldini.2
&nbsp;1v:2 
There are beautiful things at the Royal Academy this year; among others Tissot has 3 paintings.3
I’ve been drawing again recently, but it was nothing special.4
I was glad to see in your letter that you visit the Haanebeeks.
    Adieu, goodbye for now, give my regards to all my friends. Ever,

Your brother.
Vincent.

I’m glad you like César de Cock so much; he’s one of the few painters to have understood our Brabant intimately enough.5 I don’t know whether I told you that I met him last year in Paris.6

Dearest Betsy,
I had wanted to fill this little book with drawings for you,1 but Theo is leaving today,2 so I don’t have any more time. You’ll just have to have it the way it is, and when I come back next year I’ll make a new one. Next Monday3 I’m going back to London with my sister Anna, to the house I’ve drawn for you,4 and then I’ll be travelling on the little steamboat that I’ve 
&nbsp;1v:2  drawn here.5 Well, Betsy, adieu, until next year.

Helvoirt, 10 July 1874

My dear Theo,
Thanks for the information you got. We’re now staying a day longer and will arrive in London on Wednesday morning.
I gave you the photo in the Forbes catalogue1 here already, because I thought it would interest you, being the Scheldt and therefore Belgium. It’s of a painting by Cap.2 It’s not so very beautiful, but at least it’s original. I’ll write to you soon from London. I wish you well.

Vincent.

London, 21 July 1874.

My dear Theo,
Yesterday a crate was sent to The Hague in which I put a photo of a J. Maris and also ‘The landlady’s daughter’ I promised,1 both of which I hope you’ll hang up in your room.
There’s a photo in the same crate of a Thijs Maris for Mr Tersteeg.2
Schüller at Paris3 sent me 6 copies of both, which I needed in order to give away. I can’t spare another of the Thijs Maris.
Anna and I arrived in London safe and sound,4 and will manage here somehow. 
&nbsp;1r:2 
I’m not saying that we’ll find something quickly, but each day that she’s here she learns something, and in any case I believe there’s more chance of her finding something here than in Holland.
It’s wonderful for me to walk with her through the streets in the evening; I then find everything here just as beautiful as I did when I first arrived.
I wish you well, old chap, and give my regards to the Rooses, Haanebeeks and Carbentuses5 if you see any of them.
I’m learning to swim.
Write to me whether you’ve begun reading Michelet6 and what you think of it. That book was a revelation to me. Adieu,

Vincent

Regards from Anna.
","-------------------------27 = 
 
London, 31 July 1874

My dear Theo,
I’m glad you’ve been reading Michelet and that you really understand it. A book like that at least teaches one to see that there’s a lot more to love than people usually think.
That book was a revelation and immediately a gospel to me.1

‘There is no such thing as an old woman!’2

(This isn’t to say that there are no old women, but that a woman doesn’t grow old as long as she loves and is loved.)
And then a chapter like The longing for autumn,3 how rich it is. 
&nbsp;1r:2 
That a woman is ‘a completely different being’ from a man, and a being that we do not yet know, or at least only very superficially, as you say, yes, that I certainly believe. And that a woman and a man can become one, that is, one whole and not two halves, that I believe too.
Anna is managing well, we go on wonderful walks together. It’s so beautiful here, if only one has a good and a single eye,4 without many beams in it.5
But if one has that, then it’s beautiful everywhere.
Pa isn’t at all better,6 even though he and Ma say he is. Yesterday we received a letter with all kinds of plans (whether we shouldn’t try this and that), which would be unfeasible and certainly useless, and at the end Pa said yet again that he’d leave it all to us7 &amp;c. &amp;c. Rather feeble and disagreeable, Theo, and it reminded me so much of Grandfather’s8 letters, but what can be done about it? Our dear aunts9 are staying 
&nbsp;1v:3  there now, and are certainly doing a lot of good!
Things are as they are, and what is a body to do about it, as Young Jochem said.10
Anna and I look at the newspaper faithfully every day and answer the advertisements if there are any. Moreover, we’ve already registered with a Governess agency. So we’re doing what we can. More haste, less speed.
It’s good that you go to the Haanebeeks so often; give everyone there my warm regards and give them some news of me.
That painting by Thijs Maris that Mr Tersteeg bought11 must be beautiful, I’ve already heard about it, and I myself have already bought and sold one completely in the same genre.12
My passion for drawing has again vanished here in England,13 but maybe inspiration will strike again one day. 
&nbsp;1v:4  I’m reading a lot again.
We’ll probably be moving on 1 January 1875 to another, larger gallery. Mr Obach is in Paris at the moment, deciding whether or not we’ll take over that gallery.
Don’t mention this to anyone for the time being.
I wish you well; write to us again soon. Anna takes quite some pleasure in paintings,14 and has rather a good eye. She already finds Boughton, Maris and Jacquet beautiful, for example, so that’s a start. Between you and me, I think we’ll have trouble finding something for her, everywhere they say she’s too young and they require German as well, but at any rate she certainly has more of a chance here than in Holland. Adieu

Vincent

You can imagine how wonderful it is for me to be here with Anna. Tell Mr T. that the paintings arrived in good order15 and that I’ll write to him soon.

London, 10 Aug. 1874

My dear Theo,
‘Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.’1
‘He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.’2
So stick to your own ideas, and if you doubt the goodness of them, test them against those of him who dared to say ‘I am the truth’,3 or against those of some humane person, such as Michelet.
  Purity of soul and impurity of body can go together.4 You know the Margaret at the fountain by Ary Scheffer;5 is there a purer being than that girl ‘who loved so much’?6
‘Leys is not an imitator, but a kindred spirit’ is a true saying that touched me as well.7 One could say the same of some of Tissot’s paintings, of his Walk in the snow, Walk 
&nbsp;1v:2  on the ramparts, Margaret in church, &amp;c.8
What is the subject of Fagel’s Leys?9
Buy Alphonse Karr’s ‘Voyage autour de mon jardin’ with the money I gave you.10 Be sure to do it, I want you to read it.
Anna and I take a walk every evening; it’s already the beginning of autumn, and that makes nature even more serious and intimate.
We’re going to move and will live in a house completely overgrown with ivy;11 we’ll write to you again soon from there.  Regards to everyone who asks after me.

Vincent 
","-------------------------29 = 
 
My dear Theo,

I’ve filled your little book1 and I believe it’s turned out well. Send me The cliff by Jules Breton when you get the chance.2
    Our gallery is now finished and it’s beautiful3, we have many beautiful things at the moment: Jules Dupré, Michel, Daubigny, Maris,4 Israëls, Mauve, Bisschop, &amp;c. We’re going to hold an exhibition in April.5 Mr Boussod6 has promised to send us the best that can be had: Malaria by Hébert,7 The cliff by J. Breton, &amp;c.8
I’d like so much to have you here, we must make sure that it happens sometime. I’d like so much to show you my room &amp;c. There’s a beautiful exhibition of old art here,9 including a large Descent from the Cross by Rembrandt, 5 large figures at twilight,10 you can imagine the sentiment. 5 Ruisdaels,11 1 Frans Hals,12 Van Dyck.13 A landscape with figures by Rubens,14 a landscape, an autumn evening, by Titian.15 2 portraits by Tintoretto16 and beautiful old English art, Reynolds, Romney and Old Crome, landscape,17 magnificent.
Adieu, I’ll send your little book at the first opportunity.18 Write to me soon.

6 March 1875

My dear Theo,
Bravo Theo – You well understood that girl in Adam Bede.1 That landscape – in which a dull yellow sandy road leads over the hill to the village, with mud or whitewashed huts with green, moss-covered roofs and here and there a blackthorn, on either side brown heather and bunt and a grey sky, with a narrow white strip above the horizon – is by Michel.2 Except that the atmosphere is purer and nobler than in Michel.
Today I’m enclosing that little book3 for you in the crate to be sent. Also Jesus by Renan4 and Jeanne d’Arc by Michelet,5 and also a portrait of 
&nbsp;1r:2  Corot, from the London News, which I also have hanging in my room.6
I don’t believe there’s any chance that you’ll be transferred to the London branch for the time being.
Don’t feel bad because you’re not finding things difficult; I have it easy, too. I believe that life is quite long, and the time when ‘another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not’7 will come of its own accord. Adieu, give my regards to everyone I know.
With a handshake,

Vincent

6 April 1875

My dear Theo,
Thanks for your letter. Didn’t I copy out Meeresstille by Heine in your little book?1 Some time ago I saw a painting by Thijs Maris2 that reminded me of it.3
An old Dutch town with rows of brownish red houses with step-gables and tall flights of steps, grey roofs, and white or yellow doors, window-frames and cornices; canals with ships and a large white drawbridge, a barge with a man at the tiller going under it. The little house of the bridge-keeper, whom one sees through the window, sitting in his office.
Some distance away a stone bridge over the canal, with people and a cart with white horses crossing it.
And everywhere movement, a porter with 
&nbsp;1v:2  his wheelbarrow, a man leaning against the railing, gazing into the water, women in black with white caps.
The foreground a quay with paving-stones and a black railing.
In the distance a tower rises above the houses.
A greyish white sky over everything.
It’s a small painting, upright. The subject is nearly the same as the large J. Maris, Amsterdam,4 which you perhaps know, only this is talent and the other is genius.
I’ve again copied out one or two things for you, which I’ll send when I get the chance.
Think of ‘The cliff’5 and whether you know of anything else. That Victor Hugo piece is beautiful.6 Adieu, give my regards to Pa if you see him.7

London, April 1875

My dear Theo,
I’m sending you herewith a small drawing. I made it last Sunday, the morning a daughter (13 years old) of my landlady died.1
It’s a view of Streatham Common,2 a large, grass-covered area with oak trees and broom.
It had rained in the night, and the ground was soggy here and there and the young spring grass fresh and green.
As you see, it’s scribbled on the title page of the ‘Poesies d’Edmond Roche’.3
There are beautiful ones among them, serious and 
&nbsp;1v:2  sad, including one that begins and ends

Sad and alone, I climbed the sad, bare dune,
Where the sea keens its ceaseless moaning plaint,
The dune where dies the wide unfurling wave,
Drab path that winds and winds upon itself again.4

and another, ‘Calais’

How I love to see you once again, o my native town,
Dear sea nymph seated at the waters’ edge!

I love the soaring spire of your bell-tower,
Lovely in its boldness and its elegance,
Its fretted cupola, through which we see the sky.5

      You’ll probably be curious about what goes with the etching by Corot6 and so I’ve copied that out as well. 
&nbsp;1v:3 
The pond
to Corot

We watched the pond, its water leaden, drear,
Form crease upon crease slowly in the breeze,
And the mud, enfolding in a softened line
The prow and black sides of a boat aground; 

The woods’ high crown, leaf by fallen leaf,
Lay strewn upon the ground; the sky was filled with mist;
We two, in whispers, almost furtively, Were sadly saying, ‘Summer’s past:

These slopes have lost their accustomed grace;
No more green foliage, no more golden light
Trembling in the trembling water or touching s with gold!’

This idyll may yet come before our eyes again,
If you would have it so: are you not the master
Who re-created it after its first creator’s hand?

Ville-d’Avray7


&nbsp;1r:4 
Warm regards, and I wish you the best. Adieu

London, 8 May 1875

My dear Theo,
Thanks for your last letter. How is the patient?1 I’d already heard from Pa that she was ill, but I didn’t know that it was as bad as you said.2
Write to me about this soon, if you will. Yes, old boy, ‘what shall we say?’3
C.M. and Mr Tersteeg were here and left again last Saturday. In my opinion they went a little too often to the Crystal Palace and other places that didn’t concern them. It seems to me they could also have come and seen where I lived.
You ask about Anna, but we’ll discuss that another time.4 
&nbsp;1v:2 
I hope and believe that I’m not what many think me to be at present, we’ll see, we have to give it time; people will probably say the same about you in a couple of years; at least if you continue to be what you are: my brother in two senses of the word.5
Regards, and my regards to the patient. With a handshake,

Vincent


&nbsp;1v:3 
To act on the world one must die to oneself. The people that makes itself the missionary of a religious thought has no other country henceforth than that thought.
Man is not placed on the earth merely to be happy; nor is he placed here merely to be honest, he is here to accomplish great things through society, to arrive at nobleness, and to outgrow the vulgarity in which the existence of almost all individuals drags on.

Paris, 31 May 1875

My dear Theo,
Thanks for your letter of this morning.
Yesterday I saw the Corot exhibition.1 It included a painting of the ‘Mount of Olives’;2 I’m glad he painted that.
On the right, a group of olive trees, dark against the darkening blue sky; in the background hills covered with shrubs and a couple of tall trees, above them the evening star.
There are 3 Corots at the Salon, very beautiful, the most beautiful one, painted shortly before his death, ‘Women cutting wood’, will probably appear as a woodcut in L’Illustration or Le Monde Illustré.3
I’ve also seen the Louvre and the Luxembourg, as you can imagine.
The Ruisdaels in the Louvre are magnificent, especially ‘The bush’, ‘The breakwater’ and ‘The ray of sunlight’.4 &nbsp;1r:2  I wish you could see the small Rembrandts there, the ‘Supper at Emmaus’,5 and two pendants, ‘The philosophers’.6
I recently saw Jules Breton with his wife and two daughters.7 Physically he reminded me of J. Maris, though he has dark hair.
When I have the chance I’ll send you a book of his, ‘Les champs et la mer’, which contains all his poems.8
He has a beautiful painting at the Salon, ‘The feast of St John’, peasant girls dancing on a summer evening round the St John’s bonfire, in the background the village with its church and the moon above it.9

Dance, young maidens, dance,
As you sing your songs of love!
Tomorrow, at break of day,
You’ll go, hastening to ply your sickles.10

There are now 3 paintings by him in the Luxembourg. ‘Procession through a cornfield’, ‘Women gleaning’ and ‘Alone’.11

Paris, 19 June 1875

My dear Theo,
I had hoped to see her again before she died,1 and that didn’t happen. Man proposes and God disposes.2
In the first crate we send to Holland you’ll find a photo of that painting by P. de Champaigne,3 of which Michelet said, ‘she stayed with me for 30 years, coming back to me incessantly’,4 also an etching by Daubigny after Ruisdael’s ‘Bush’,5 a lithograph after Corot’s ‘Sunset’,6 a lithograph by Bodmer, ‘Fontainebleau in the autumn’7 and two Jacque etchings.8

I don’t know how long I’ll be staying here, but before I return to London I hope to go to Helvoirt.9 I hope you’ll be there too. I’ll pay for the journey.

You certainly won’t forget her and her death, but keep it to yourself. This is one of those things that, little by little, makes us ‘sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing’;10 and that we must become.

Paris, 29 June 1875

My dear Theo,
I’d rather that you were out of The Hague.1 Don’t you sometimes long for that as well? Write and tell me, yes or no?
I’m staying here for the time being, and will probably not go to Holland before the autumn.
In the first crate going to The Hague you’ll find a package for Helvoirt. Please send it on after looking at what’s inside. There are a few lithographs &amp;c. which I’d like to see in Pa’s study with the ‘Funeral in the cornfield’ by Van der Maaten.2 Anker’s painting of ‘An old Huguenot’, a photo of which is in the package in question, I sold to Uncle Vincent, who was here a couple of days ago.3 He also bought 
&nbsp;1r:2  a beautiful painting by Jacque, horses pulling a plough in the rain.4
There was a sale here of drawings by Millet, I don’t know whether I’ve already written to you about it. When I entered the room in Hôtel Drouot where they were exhibited,5 I felt something akin to: Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.6 You know that Millet lived in Gréville. Well, I don’t know whether it was Gréville or Granville where the man I once told you about died.7 At any rate, I looked at Millet’s drawings of ‘The cliffs at Gréville’ with redoubled attention.8 A painting of his, ‘The church of Gréville’, is now in the Luxembourg.9

Paris, 15 July 1875

My dear Theo,

Uncle Vincent was here again, we were together quite a lot and talked about one thing and another. I asked him whether he thought there would be an opportunity to get you here, into the Paris branch. At first he wouldn’t hear of it, and said it was much better that you stay in The Hague; but I kept insisting, and you can be sure that he’ll bear it in mind.
When he comes to The Hague he’ll probably talk to you; stay calm and let him have his say; it won’t do you any harm, and later on you’ll probably need him now and again. You shouldn’t talk about me if it’s not the right moment.
He’s terribly clever, when I was here last winter1 one of the things he said to me was ‘perhaps I know nothing of supernatural things, but of natural things I know everything’. I’m not sure whether those were his exact words, but that was the gist of it. 
&nbsp;1r:2 
I also want to tell you that one of his favourite paintings is ‘Lost illusions’ by Gleyre.2
Sainte-Beuve said, ‘There is in most men a poet who died young, whom the man survived’3 and Musset, ‘know that in us there is often a sleeping poet, ever young and alive’.4 I believe that the former is true of Uncle Vincent. So you know who it is you’re dealing with, and so be warned.
Don’t hesitate to ask him openly to have you sent here or to London.
I thank you for your letter of this morning, and for the verse by Rückert. Do you have his poems? I’d like to know more of them. When there’s an opportunity I’ll send you a French Bible and L’imitation de Jesus Christ.5 This was probably the favourite book of that woman whom P. de Champaigne painted;6 in the Louvre there’s a portrait, also by P. de C., of her daughter, a nun; she has L’imitation lying on a chair next to her.7
Pa once wrote to me: ‘you know that the same lips that uttered “be harmless as doves” also immediately added “and wise as serpents”’.8 You should bear 
&nbsp;1v:3  that in mind as well, and believe me to be ever

Your loving brother
Vincent

Do you have the photos of the Meissoniers in the gallery?9 Look at them often; he painted men. You may well know The smoker at the window and The young man having lunch.10

Paris, 24 July 1875

My dear Theo,
A couple of days ago we got a painting by De Nittis, a view of London on a rainy day, Westminster Bridge and the Houses of Parliament.1 I crossed Westminster Bridge every morning and evening and know what it looks like when the sun’s setting behind Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament, and what it’s like early in the morning, and in the winter with snow and fog.
When I saw this painting I felt how much I love London.
Yet I believe it’s good for me to be away from it. This in answer to your question. I certainly don’t think that you’ll be going to London. 
&nbsp;1r:2 
Thanks for ‘Aus der Jugendzeit’ and ‘Um Mitternacht’ by Rückert.2 It’s poignantly beautiful; the latter made me think of ‘La nuit de Décembre’ by Musset.3 I wish I could send it to you, but don’t have it.
Yesterday we sent a crate to The Hague, what I had promised you was in it.4
I hear that Anna and Lies are at home; I’d like to see them again. I wish you the very best, and write again soon. With a handshake

I’m glad that Pa has accepted the call to Etten;1 under the circumstances I also think it good that Willemien is going along with Anna.2 I’d also have liked to be with all of you that Sunday at Helvoirt;3 have I already told you that I was with Soek and his family at Ville-d’Avray that day?4 I was surprised to find 3 paintings by Corot in the church there.5
On Sunday last and Sunday a fortnight ago6 I went to Mr Mercier’s7 church and heard him speak on ‘all things work together for good to them that love God’8 (in Dutch it says ‘for those who love God all things will work together for good’) and on ‘He created man in his own image’,9 it was glorious and grand. You should also go to church every Sunday if you can, even if it isn’t so very beautiful;

[Letterhead: Goupil Paris]

My dear Theo,
Thanks for your last letter and for the poem by Rückert.
On Sunday I went again to Mr Bersier, his sermon was based on the text ‘It is not lawful for thee’,1 he concluded with ‘Happy are they for whom life has all its thorns’.2
Here are some words which I know Uncle Vincent is very fond of:
‘Rejoice, young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgement. Remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity.Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, 
&nbsp;1r:2  when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them.’3 Yet I find even more beautiful:
‘Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.’4 And ‘Thy will be done’5 and ‘Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil’.6
Herewith a note for Mr Tersteeg, asking him if he would frame 2 engravings, ‘Good Friday’7 and ‘St Augustine’,8 which you’ll find in the next crate. And will you please be so kind as to send them to Helvoirt around 10 Sept.9 I’d really like them to be from both of us, so that you pay 2.50 guilders towards the frames. I told Mr Tersteeg that you’d write and tell me what they cost and then I’d send him the money. You can give me the 2.50 guilders when we see each other. That probably won’t be before Christmas; I believe it’s better not to ask for any time off before then. This evening I’m going to dine with Mr Hamman.10 Adieu, write again soon, and believe me

Paris, 2 Sept. 1875

My dear Theo,
This morning I heard from Pa and from you the news of Uncle Jan’s death.1 Such things make us say, ‘O Lord, join us intimately to one another and let our love for Thee make that bond ever stronger’2 and ‘Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man’.3
In the first crate of paintings going to Holland you’ll find a few lithographs and that engraving after Rembrandt.4 The two lithographs after Bonington will no doubt be to your liking. At the same time I’m sending a couple of photos for Pa of pictures by Jules Breton and Corot; I’ll write ‘for Helvoirt’ on the back.
I’ve never heard of the painter Pynas you write about; I’m eager to see the painting in question.5 Nor do I know that lithograph after Diaz, ‘A monk’.6

Last Sunday I was in the Louvre (on Sunday I often go either there or to the Luxembourg); I wish you could see the Van Ostade, his own family, himself, his wife and, I believe, 8 children, all in black, the wife and girls with white caps and neckerchiefs in a stately old Dutch room with a large fireplace, oak wainscoting and ceiling and whitewashed walls with paintings in black frames. In the corner of the room a large bed with blue curtains and blanket.7 Rembrandt’s ‘Supper at Emmaus’, of which I wrote,8 has been engraved,9 Messrs G&amp;Co. will publish the engraving in the autumn. Do you ever visit Borchers? It seems to me that his mother is a distinguished lady.10 Go out often, if you can, I mean of course to visit Caroline van Stockum, the Carbentuses, Haanebeeks, Borchers &amp;c.; not to Kraft’s11 or Marda’s,12 you understand! Or it would have to be because you couldn’t do otherwise, just once or twice can do no harm.
How are things at the gallery? I know all about how it can be sometimes, but anyway, do whatever your hand finds to do.13
And I wish you the very best, and write again soon. Ever,

Your loving brother
Vincent

Herewith a note for Borchers. Regards to everyone at the Rooses’ and to all who ask after me. B.14 tells me that Weehuizen died,15 I didn’t know, were you there?

My dear Borchers,
      Thanks for your letter, which I received this morning and which gave me pleasure. I hope to come to Holland at Christmas and, if I can, immediately to The Hague, and we must then make sure not to miss each other.
      I’m glad that you still have a passion for reading, that’s always good, at least such books as you read. I still keep it up, too; an employee in our office1 who has gone on holiday 
      &nbsp;1v:2  to Holland has just promised to bring me a copy of ‘Motley, Geschiedenis der 17 provinciën’.2
As you know, I’m now in Paris; so I’ve wandered rather a lot since we saw each other on my last day in The Hague,3 and it seems to me that it was a great deal longer than 2 years ago.
Warm regards, give my regards to your Mother and sisters as well,4 and believe me

Ever yours,
V.W. van Gogh

Paris, 4 Sept. 75

My dear Theo,
I’m sending you herewith my letter for Ma’s birthday,1 please enclose it with yours. I’ve bought a book about Michel, with etchings after his paintings;2 I’ll send it to you as soon as I’ve finished it. Michel, though, isn’t nearly so beautiful as that landscape described in that passage in Adam Bede,3 which we both found so moving. Bonington, 
    &nbsp;1v:2  too, almost painted it, and yet that isn’t it either.
When you’ve finished the book I’d like to ask you to give it in my name to Uncle Cor to read, when you have the opportunity of course, though I’m giving it to you. I see the paintings themselves, so naturally you can have the description and etchings after them.
My regards to the Haanebeeks, Carbentuses, Van Stockums, Mauve, Rooses &amp;c. if the occasion presents itself. I wish you the very best. Ever

Your loving brother
Vincent

Give the book on Michel to Mr Tersteeg to read, too.

The Hague, 7 Sept. 1875

My dear Vincent,
Weehuizen died last spring. I thought you knew. He died very suddenly, after being ill for a couple of days. He died in hospital without anyone with him. I very much regretted not being with him. I had been with him a lot before then. He had read the book by Michelet, ‘L’amour’,1 and had talked a lot about it with me; he thought it so beautiful, and he loved nature so much 
&nbsp;1v:2  and sought in it a quiet melancholy.
Last Sunday I heard a beautiful sermon. Jesus wept.2
I thank you for the lithographs and the book by Michel that you’ve promised me;3 I’m eager to see them.
I gave your letter to Borchers, they look like good people. I hope to go there more often. Today we received the nouveautés, which included the print after Rembrandt.4 It looks beautiful, the figure of Jesus, in particular, is beautiful, and the whole is noble. Adieu, I wish you well.

Your loving
Theo

The frames for the engravings for Ma’s birthday5 cost 4 guilders apiece.
","-------------------------46 = 
 
My dear Theo,
You hadn’t expected to get this letter back again,1 had you?
No, old boy, this isn’t the path to follow.
The death of Weehuizen is certainly sad, but sad in a different way than you say.
Keep your eyes open and try to become strong and resolute. Was that book by Michelet2 really meant for him?
Actually, I’d like to suggest something to you, Theo, which will perhaps amaze you:
Read no more Michelet or any other book (except the Bible) until we’ve seen each other again at Christmas, and do what I told you, go often in the evenings to the Van Stockums, Borchers &amp;c. I believe you won’t regret it, you’ll feel much freer as soon as you’ve started this regimen. Be careful with the words I underlined in your letter.3
There is quiet melancholy, certainly, thank God, but I don’t know if we’re allowed to feel it yet, you see I say we, I no more than you.
Pa wrote to me recently ‘Melancholy does not hurt, but makes us see things with a holier eye’. That is true ‘quiet melancholy’, fine gold,4 but we aren’t that far yet, not by a long way. Let us hope and pray that we may come so far and believe me ever

Your loving brother
Vincent

I’m already a little bit further than you and already see, alas, that the expression ‘childhood and youth are vanity’5 are almost completely true. So remain steadfast, old chap; I heartily shake your hand.

Paris. 12 Sept. 1875.

My dear Theo,

Wings, wings above life!
Wings over the grave and death!1

That’s what we need, and I’m beginning to see that we can acquire them. Doesn’t Pa have them, for instance? And you know how he got them, through prayer and the fruits thereof: patience and faith,2 and through the Bible, which was a light unto his path and a lamp unto his feet.3
This afternoon I heard a beautiful sermon on ‘forget that which is behind you’;4 part of which was: ‘Have more hope than remembrances; what there was of seriousness and blessings in your past life is not lost; do not reflect on it any longer, you will find it elsewhere, but keep moving forward. All things are become new in Jesus Christ’.5
Keep your chin up, and believe me

Your loving brother
Vincent

If it’s indeed true that childhood and youth are vanity6 (always bearing in mind what’s written above, and remembering that although one has to start anew later, a well-spent youth is worth a fortune), shouldn’t it then be our ambition and hope to become men like Pa and others? Let us both hope and pray for this. My regards to everyone who asks after me.

You know the etching by Rembrandt, Burgomaster Six standing in front of the window, reading.7 I know that Uncle Vincent and Cor like it very much, and I sometimes think that they must have looked like that when they were younger. You also know the portrait of Six when he was older,8 I believe there’s an engraving of it in your shop.9 That life of his must have been a fine and serious life.

My dear Theo,
The photographs of the J. Breton and the Corot are for Helvoirt;1 the rest are for you.
Send on the Helvoirt ones when you have the opportunity, but I’ll do my best to get another copy of the Rembrandt,2 so perhaps it would be better to delay sending them until I’ve sent you that one as well.
You’ll have received my letter of yesterday by now.

Warm regards,

Paris, 17 Sept. 1875.

My dear Theo,
Feeling, even a fine feeling, for the beauties of nature isn’t the same as religious feeling, although I believe that the two are closely connected. The same is true of a feeling for art. Don’t give in to that too much either.1
Hold fast especially to your love for the firm and for your work and to respect for Mr Tersteeg. Later on you’ll see, better than now, that he deserves it. You don’t have to take it to extremes, though.
Nearly everyone has a feeling for nature, some more than others, but there are few who feel that God is a spirit, and they that worship Him must worship him in spirit and in truth.2 Pa is one of the few, Ma too, and also Uncle Vincent, I believe.
You know that it is written ‘The world passeth away and all its glory’,3 and that on the other hand there are also the words ‘that part which shall not be taken away’,4 about ‘a well of living water springing up into everlasting life’.5 Let us also pray that we may become rich in God.6 But don’t think too deeply about these things, which will become clearer to you of themselves with time 
&nbsp;1v:2 , and just do what I’ve advised you to do. Let us ask for our part in life that we may become the poor in the kingdom of God,7 God’s servants.8 We haven’t achieved this yet, however, for often there are beams in our eye9 of which we ourselves are unaware; let us ask that our eye may become single,10 for then we shall be completely single.
My regards to the Rooses and if anyone should ask after me, and believe me ever,

Your loving brother

My dear Theo,
The way is narrow,1 so we must be careful. You know how others have arrived where we wish to go; let us take that simple path as well. ora et labora.2
Let us do our daily work, whatever the hand finds to do, with all our might,3 and let us believe that God will give good gifts, a part that shall not be taken away,4 to those who pray to Him for it. And let us trust in God with all our heart and lean not unto our own understanding.5 God’s will and not ours.6
‘Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new’. II Cor. 5:18.7
I’m going to get rid of all my books by Michelet &amp;c. &amp;c., you should too.8
How I’m longing for Christmas, but let’s be patient, that time will come soon enough.
Keep well, old chap, and give my regards to all my acquaintances, and believe me

Your loving brother
Vincent


&nbsp;1r:2 
I’ll send the money for the frames9 as soon as possible; when I write to Mr Tersteeg I’ll tell him that I don’t have much money at the moment, because I’ve asked our cashier to keep back part of my monthly wages as I’ll be needing a good deal of money around Christmas for my trip &amp;c.
I hope, though, that it won’t be so very long before I can send it.
  If I were you I wouldn’t go to Borchers all that often.
&nbsp;1v:3 
Don’t you find these words beautiful? I Cor 2:4 and 510

For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man’s wisdom, that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.

My dear Theo,
‘The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: the kingdom of God is within you.’1 ‘The Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister’,2 and we who want to become His disciples, Christians, we are no better than our Master.3 Blessed are the poor in spirit,4 blessed are the pure in heart.5
Narrow is the way, which leadeth unto Life, and few there be that find it.6 Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.7
My brother, let us take care; let us ask Him who is above, who also maketh intercession for us,8 
&nbsp;1r:2  that He should not take us out of the world, but that He should keep us from the evil.9 Yea, let us watch and be sober,10 let us trust in the Lord with all our heart, and lean not unto our own understanding.11 Let us ask that He compel us to come in,12 that He give us a Christian life to fulfil; that He teach us to deny ourselves, daily to take up our cross and to follow Him;13 to be meek, longsuffering,14 and lowly in heart.15
A part which shall not be taken away,16 a well of living water17 springing up into everlasting life,18 these are the good gifts that He who heareth prayer,19 the Giver of all perfect gifts,20 will give to those who pray to Him for them.
And in addition to all this, the assurance that there is ‘a house of the Father in which there are many mansions,21 and that when He has prepared a place for us there22 He will draw all men unto Him.23 And to comfort us in this life, on our way to our Father’s house, ‘the Comforter, the Spirit of Truth,24 who will guide us into all truth’.25 
&nbsp;1v:3  The Christian life nevertheless has its dark side too; it is mainly men’s work.
Those who walk with God,26 God’s friends, God’s pious followers, those who worship Him in Spirit and in Truth,27 have been proved and tried,28 and have oft-times received from God a thorn in the flesh;29 blessed will we be when we can repeat after our father, Paul: when I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child: but now that I have become a man, I put away childish things,30 and I became, and God made me: sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing.31
Write to me soon, and give my regards to all my acquaintances, and believe me

Be careful, old boy, don’t lose your resilience.1
See things as they are, and, for yourself, don’t think everything good.
One can deviate, both to the left hand and to the right hand.2 Remember what Pa no doubt once told you too: understanding and feeling must go together.

I advised you to go out quite a lot, but if you don’t like it, don’t do it. You know that I didn’t go out so very much either, and that people often remarked upon it.
How much I’d like for us to be able to breakfast together or drink a cup of chocolate in my room. Keep well, old chap. Don’t take things that don’t concern you directly too much to heart, and don’t let them weigh upon you too heavily. How is it going, eating bread? Have you tried it yet?

I do know that things aren’t easy for you at the moment, old chap, but remain steadfast and be brave; ‘Not to dream, not to sigh’3 is also necessary sometimes.
You know ‘that you are not alone but that the Father is with you’.4 I shake your hand heartily in thought. Ever,

Paris, 6 Oct. 1875

My dear Theo,
Even though I wrote to you only recently, I want to do so again anyway, because I know how difficult life can sometimes be. Keep your chin up, old boy, after rain comes sunshine, just keep hoping for that.
Rain and sunshine alternate on ‘the road that goes uphill all the way, yes to the very end’, and from time to time one also rests on ‘the journey that takes the whole day long, from morn till night’.1 So think now and often after this, that ‘this also will pass away’.2
And especially, you too should ask: Create in me a new heart, O God; 
&nbsp;1r:2  and renew a right spirit within me.3
Today I had the opportunity to send a package to Anna and Willemien. Among other things I sent her L’imitation de Jesus Christ4 and several books of the Bible, published separately, in the same edition as the Psalms I sent you.
Read them faithfully. Would you perhaps like the 4 Gospels and some of the epistles, printed separately?
I also sent Anna several prints – including Rembrandt, Reading the Bible and The supper at Emmaus (an old engraving, by De Frey, I believe),5 Philippe de Champaigne, Portrait of a lady,6 a large, beautiful etching after Chaigneau, Shepherdess and sheep,7 and then Dupré, Evening,8 Troyon, Morning,9 Bodmer, Fontainebleau,10 Français, Last fine days,11 Frère, Seamstresses, and A cooper,12 Daubigny, After sunset,13 &amp;c. &amp;c., as well as a couple of photos, namely of Delaroche, Gethsemane No. 424, Good Friday and Mater Dolorosa14 and Brion, The farewells.15
I hope so much that things will continue to go well for Anna there. She keeps up her courage, I know so well that she sometimes finds things so difficult.
And yet ‘one has one’s good days’ as Jules Dupré often said,16 let’s go on believing that. 
&nbsp;1v:3 
I’d very much like to have the Dutch hymns. When you get the opportunity, do you think you could manage to send the cheapest edition that can be found? I have the Psalms.
There are also some beautiful English hymns,b including this one:

Thy way not mine, o Lord
However dark it be,
Lead me by thine own hand
Choose out the path for me.

I dare not choose my lot;
I would not if I might;
Choose Thou for me, my God,
So shall I walk aright.

The kingdom that I seek,
Is thine; so let the way
That leads to it be thine
Else I must surely stray.

Choose Thou for me my friend
My sickness, or my health;
Choose Thou my cares for me,
My poverty my wealth.

Not mine, not mine, the choice
In things or great or small
Be Thou my Guide my strength
My wisdom and my all.17

and the following:

Nearer my God to Thee
Nearer to Thee!
E’en though it be a cross
That raiseth me;
Still all my song shall be
Nearer my God to Thee
Nearer to Thee. 
&nbsp;1v:4 

Though like a wanderer,
The sun gone down,
Darkness come over me
My rest a stone;
Yet in my dreams I’d be
Nearer, my God, to Thee
Nearer to Thee!

There let my way appear
Steps unto Heaven;
All that Thou sendest me
In mercy given
Angels to beckon me
Nearer, my God, to Thee
Nearer to Thee.18

Oft in sorrow and in woe
Onward, Christians, onward go;
Fight the fight, maintain the strife,
Strengthen’d with the bread of life.

Let your drooping hearts be glad;
March in heavenly armour clad:
Fight, nor think the battle long,
Soon shall vict’ry tune your song
 
Let not sorrow dim your eye,
Soon shall ev’ry tear be dry;
Let not fear your course impede,
Great your strength, if great your need!19

Give my regards to my acquaintances. How is Caroline van Stockum? Give my special regards to her, and believe me

Your most loving brother
Vincent

Does the road go uphill then all the way?
‘Yes to the very end’.
And will the journey take all day long?
‘From morn till night, my friend’.20

Paris, 11 October 1875

My dear Theo,
Thanks for your letter of this morning. This time I’d like to write to you as I seldom do; I’d actually like to tell you in detail about my life here.
As you know, I live in Montmartre. Also living here is a young Englishman, an employee of the firm, 18 years old, the son of an art dealer in London, who will probably enter his father’s firm later on.1 He had never been away from home and was tremendously boorish, especially the first few weeks he was here; he ate, for example, mornings, afternoons and evenings 4-6 sous2 worth of bread (bread, nota bene, is cheap here) and supplemented that with pounds of apples and pears &amp;c. In spite of all that he’s as lean as a pole, with two strong rows of teeth, large red lips, sparkling 
&nbsp;1r:2  eyes, a couple of large, usually red, jug-ears, a shorn head (black hair) &amp;c. &amp;c.
I assure you, an altogether different creature from that lady by Philippe de Champaigne.3 This young person was ridiculed a lot in the beginning, even by me. But I nonetheless warmed to him gradually and now, I assure you, I’m very glad of his company in the evenings. He has a completely naїve and unspoiled heart, and works very hard in the firm. Every evening we go home together, eat something or other in my room, and the rest of the evening I read aloud, usually from the Bible. We intend to read it all the way through.4 In the morning, he’s already there to wake me up, usually between 5 and 6 o’clock; we then have breakfast in my room and go to the gallery around 8 o’clock. Recently he’s begun to eat with more moderation, and he’s started to collect prints, with my help.
Yesterday we went to the Luxembourg together and I showed him the paintings I like best there. 
&nbsp;1v:3  And truthfully, unto babes is revealed much that is hidden from the wise.5

J. Breton, Alone, The blessing of the corn, Calling the gleaners6
Brion, Noah, The pilgrims of St Odile.7
Bernier, Fields in winter8
Cabat. The pond and Autumnal evening9
Emile Breton, Winter evening.10 Bodmer, Fontainebleau11
Duverger, The labourer and his children12
Millet, The church at Gréville13
Daubigny, Spring and Autumn14
Français, The end of winter and The cemetery15
Gleyre, Lost illusions16 and Hébert, Christ in the Garden of Olives and Malaria,17 also Rosa Bonheur, Ploughing18 &amp;c.

Also a painting by ? (I can’t remember his name), a monastery where monks receive a stranger and suddenly notice that it is Jesus. Written on the wall of the monastery is L’homme s’agite et Dieu le mène. Qui vous reçoit, me recoit et qui Me reçoit, reçoit celui qui m’a envoyé.19
At the gallery I simply do whatever the hand finds to do,20 that is our work our whole life long, old boy, may I do it with all my might. 
&nbsp;1v:4 
Have you done what I advised you to do, have you got rid of the books by Michelet, Renan &amp;c?21 I believe it will give you peace. You certainly won’t forget that page from Michelet about that portrait of a lady by P. de Champaigne,22 and don’t forget Renan either, but still, get rid of them. ‘If you have found honey, see to it that you don’t eat too much of it, lest it disagree with you’ it says in Proverbs, or something to that effect.23 Do you know Erckmann-Chatrian, Le conscrit, Waterloo, and especially L’ami Fritz and also Madame Thérèse?24 Read them some time if you can get hold of them. A change of fare whets the appetite (provided we take especial care to eat simply; not for nothing is it written ‘Give us this day our daily bread’),25 and the bow cannot always stay bent. You won’t take it amiss if I tell you to do one thing and another. I know you have your wits about you as well. Do not think everything good, and learn to distinguish for yourself between relative good and evil; and let that feeling show you the right way with guidance from above because, old boy, it’s so necessary ‘that God dispose us’. Do write again soon with some particulars, give my regards to my acquaintances, especially Mr Tersteeg and his family, and I wish you the very best. Adieu, believe me ever,

Your loving brother
Vincent

My dear Theo,
Yet again a few lines to cheer myself up as well as you. I advised you to get rid of your books,1 and I still advise you to do so, certainly, just do it; it will give you peace. But while you’re doing it, take care not to become narrow-minded and to shy away from reading what is well written; on the contrary, that is a comfort in our lives.
‘Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be 
&nbsp;1r:2  any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.’2
Just seek light and freedom and don’t delve too deeply into the mire of the world.
How much I’d like to have you here, and show you the Luxembourg and the Louvre &amp;c., though I have the idea that in time you’ll be coming here too.
I’ve had rather a good letter from Anna, I’m sending it to you to read, but send it back. Pa once wrote to me ‘don’t forget the story of Icarus, who wanted to fly to the sun and, having arrived at a certain height, lost his wings and fell into the sea’.3 You’ll often feel that neither I nor Anna are what we hope to become, and that we’re still a long way from Pa and others, that we’re lacking in solidity and simplicity and sincerity; one can’t become simple and true all at once. But let’s persevere nonetheless, but above all be patient, those who believe shall not make haste;4 yet there is a difference between 
&nbsp;1v:3  our desire to become Christians and that of Icarus to fly to the sun.
I believe it can do no harm to have a relatively strong body, so take care to eat enough, and if occasionally you’re terribly hungry, or rather have a terrible urge to eat, be sure to eat well. I assure you that I also do it often enough and above all, have done. Especially bread, I believe, old boy, don’t hesitate, ‘Bread is the staff of life’ as the English say5 (although they also have a taste for meat, and even much too much of it in general). And now, write to me again soon and tell me about everyday things too.
Remain steadfast, and give my regards to anyone who asks after me. Let’s hope we see each other in 10 weeks or so. I shake your hand heartily in thought, and am ever,

Your loving brother
Vincent

My dear Theo,
It’s time you heard from me again, though this will only be a short note, for I haven’t much time.
Thanks for what you sent me, I’m glad to have it. I’m glad that you were in Etten on the day of the induction, for Pa and Ma’s sake as well as yours.1 You must write and tell me what it was like.
Uncle Vincent and Aunt2 left yesterday. I went to see them quite often. I’m sorry I didn’t see them at the train yesterday when they left. Herewith a letter, give it to Uncle when you see him, it explains why we didn’t see each other at the station. 
&nbsp;1v:2 
Autumn is really here, you’ll be going for walks fairly often. Do you get up early? I do regularly, it’s good to make a habit of it. It’s precious and already very dear to me, that early morning twilight. I usually go to bed early in the evening. Every morning my worthy Englishman cooks barley porridge; how I’d like you to be here in the morning sometime.
Anna seems to get up early as well. She doesn’t have it easy, and she certainly makes herself very useful.
Well, more soon, probably. Do write again soon, and freely.

My dear Theo,
Herewith a note for Uncle Haanebeek. I hadn’t written since Annet died, and felt the need to do so at last.1
Do you ever go there? In any case you’ll deliver the letter yourself, won’t you?
My worthy Englishman now cooks barley porridge every morning; he got 25 pounds of it from his father. How I wish you could try it sometime. 
&nbsp;1v:2 
I’m really very glad to have met that boy. I’ve learned from him and was able, in turn, to draw his attention to a danger that was threatening him.
He had never been away from home and, although he didn’t let it show, he had an unwholesome (though noble) yearning for his father and his home.He yearned with a yearning that belongs to God and heaven. Idolatry is not love. He who loves his parents must follow them on life’s path. He now sees this clearly and, with some genuine sorrow in his heart, he has the courage and the desire to go on. Has Pa already said to you what he once said to me? Keep thy heart above all things; for out of it are the issues of life.2 Let us do that, then, and with God’s help we shall succeed.

I wish you well, and believe me ever

My dear Theo,
A few words in haste because tomorrow is the Feast of St Nicholas.1 That’s such a nice day in Holland, I’d like to see it again sometime.
It’s time for Christmas to come, don’t you think? We’ll have a great deal to talk about. It’s a pity that Anna can’t come either;2 I so much hope that she’ll have a good time then too. Christmas in England is very special, and perhaps Anna will become even more attached to her surroundings if she celebrates it there and helps to make things pleasant in the house there.
My worthy Englishman (his name is Gladwell) is also going home for a couple of days. You can imagine how much he longs for it; he has never really been away from home before. 
&nbsp;1r:2 
Do write again soon.
Do you ever visit Uncle Cor? If he should ever invite you, accept by all means, and give him my regards if you see him.
Is it as cold there as it is here? Gladwell and I are very cosy by our little stove, mornings and evenings.
I’ve taken up pipe-smoking again, and sometimes it tastes just as good as it used to.

This morning I heard from home what happened to you,1 and I wanted to write to you immediately.
If only I knew what I could do for you. One of these days a crate will be going to The Hague; I’ll put some chocolate in it. Gladwell calls that ‘Consolation’. I’ll also send you the little book by Jules Breton,2 at least if I can get it back. I’ve lent it out.
I’m very anxious to hear how you are, so drop me a line soon and tell me in detail, if you will, how it was with you those days.
How I’d like to be with you, Theo, but what can we do about it? It can’t be helped, old boy. In a fortnight 
&nbsp;1r:2  I’ll be going home, and then we hope to see each other in any case, and our seeing each other won’t be any the less wonderful for what has happened.
If you should see Uncle Jan,3 please give him my regards and thank him for his letter.
I received a letter from Anna today. I believe she’s reconciled to celebrating Christmas there, with a will and enthusiasm, and will help to make it a success.
You must try and become good friends with Uncle Jan; I don’t know him well, but I do know he is ‘fine gold’.4
How cold it’s been. Fortunately, it started to thaw here yesterday, which was fine with me.
These last few days I’ve been busy with the inventory &amp;c., and trying to finish off one thing and another before I leave.
And now Theo, in thought a hearty handshake, my heartfelt wishes for your recovery, old chap. Ever

Your most loving brother
Vincent.

Paris, 10 Dec. 1875

My dear Theo,
Herewith what I promised. You’ll like the book by Jules Breton. There’s one poem of his that I found especially moving: ‘Illusions’.1 Blessed are those whose hearts are thus attuned.
All things work together for good to them that love God2 is a beautiful saying. It will be so for you, too; and the aftertaste of these difficult days will be good.
But write and tell me soon how things are and when the doctor says you’ll be better, if you haven’t done so already, that is.
In a fortnight I hope to be in Etten, you can imagine how much I’m looking forward to it. 
&nbsp;1v:2 
Have I already told you that I’ve taken up pipe-smoking &amp;c. again? I’ve rediscovered in my pipe an old, trusty friend, and I imagine we’ll never part again.
I heard from Uncle Vincent that you smoke too.
Tell everyone at the Rooses’ especially that I bid them good-day; you and I have had a lot of good times in their house, and have met with much loyalty.
We have ‘Sunday morning’ by Emile Breton here at present.3 You know it, don’t you? It’s a village street with farmhouses and sheds, and at the end the church surrounded by poplars. Everything covered with snow and little black figures going to church. It tells us that winter is cold but that there are warm human hearts.
I wish you the very best, old boy, and believe me ever

Your loving brother
Vincent

The packages of chocolate marked X are for you, the other two are for Mrs Roos. Smoke the cigarettes with your housemates. Adieu.

Paris, 13 Dec. 1875

My dear Theo,
I’d been longing to receive your letter of this morning, and am very glad that you’re getting better again. The parcel for you was sent only today; the little book by Jules Breton is in it.1
I’m longing for Christmas and to see you, old boy, but now we’ll be there soon enough. I’ll probably be leaving here Thursday week, in the evening.
Do everything you can to get as long a holiday as possible.
One more thing, though, please forgive my saying it. You and I both liked the poems by Heine and Uhland,2 but watch out, old boy, it’s pretty dangerous stuff. The illusion won’t last long, don’t surrender to it.
Shouldn’t you get rid of those little books I wrote in for you?3 
&nbsp;1v:2  Those books by Heine and Uhland will fall into your hands again later on, and then you’ll read them with different feelings and with a calmer heart. I like Erckmann-Chatrian very much, you know that. Do you know L’ami Fritz?4
To return again to Heine.
Take the portrait of Father and Mother and take ‘Farewells’ by Brion,5 and then read Heine with those three before your eyes; then you’ll see what I mean. But, old chap, surely you know that I’m not lecturing you or preaching a moralizing sermon. I know you have in your heart what I have in mine, that’s why I sometimes talk to you so seriously. But in any event try this test sometime.
And now, get well soon and do write again soon. How is Willem Valkis? Give my regards to him and to all your housemates and to all who know me, also Van Iterson.
    We have a beautiful painting by Schreyer here at present, a wagon with horses in an autumnal landscape at sunset.6 Also a splendid Jacque, a sombre landscape 
&nbsp;1v:3  with sheep. What do you think of that small Jacque, ‘Ploughing’, which has been in The Hague for some time?7
I sincerely wish you the best and, again, a speedy recovery. Ever

Your loving brother.
Vincent

Dear Vincent and Theo,2
My heartfelt thanks to you both for your last letters, which we were very glad to receive.
How wonderful it will be at home at Christmas. It’s been very cold here, but now it’s very mild. Theo, how awful about your leg, is it now completely better? We’ll 
&nbsp;1v:2  probably have a Christmas tree. Our holiday begins on Thursday. And now, goodbye dear Vincent and Theo, I wish you both a very merry Christmas.

P.S. I thank you for what you sent, I was very glad to get it.

Welwyn, 30 Dec. 1875.

Dearest Vincent,
Thanks for what you sent, how sweet of you to think of us in this way. Here chocolate is also thought of as Real Consolation, especially by Nelly.1 The pictures2 have also been put to good use. We got a great deal of satisfaction from our Christmas tree at school. It was a great joy to see such happy faces, 
&nbsp;1v:2  so you can take satisfaction from what you sent, because I wouldn’t have been able to make something for everyone without those little photographs. I’m sending this letter to you to ask you to put Willemien’s portrait and our letters on Pa and Ma’s places when they come home from church on New Year’s Eve. I sincerely hope that you’ll have had a pleasant holiday at home. When will we see each other again? I hope very much that we may all be together on 21 May.3 Sometime I must ask your advice about this and that, but I’ll wait until you’re safely back in Paris. And now this year is almost over and we’re starting another. May it be a happy and blessed year for all of us, and may our love for God and one another grow. I wish you well, too, and receive in thought a hearty kiss from – 

Yours, your loving
Anna.

Paris, 10 January 1875.1

My dear Theo,
I haven’t written to you since we saw each other; in the meantime something has happened that didn’t come as a total surprise to me.
When I saw Mr Boussod again I asked if His Hon. indeed thought it a good thing for me to go on working in the firm this year, since His Hon. had never had any very serious complaints against me.
The latter was indeed the case, though, and His Hon. took the words out of my mouth, so to speak, saying that I would leave on 1 April, thanking the gentlemen for anything I might have learned in their firm.2
When an apple is ripe, all it takes is a gentle breeze to make it fall from the tree, it’s also like that here. I’ve certainly done things that were in some way very wrong, and so have little to say. 
&nbsp;1r:2 
And now, old boy, so far I’m really rather in the dark about what I should do, but we must try and keep hope and courage alive.
Be so good as to let Mr Tersteeg read this letter, His Hon. may know it, but I believe it’s better that you speak to no one else of it for the time being, and behave as if nothing is going on.
Do write again soon, and believe me ever,

Your loving brother
Vincent.

Paris, January 1876

My dear Theo,
In the first crate going to The Hague you’ll find various packages; be so good as to take care of them.
First of all, one for you containing ‘Felix Holt’,1 when you’ve read it please send it to Etten, and when they’ve finished it there please send it back here, when you get the chance, because it doesn’t belong to me. It’s a book that touched me deeply, and it will no doubt have the same effect on you.
There’s also a package for Mr Tersteeg and one for Mrs Tersteeg, and also one for Mauve and his wife.2 I wrote and told Mauve that he should ask you for that book about Michel;3 please show it to him sometime when it suits you. 
&nbsp;1r:2 
There’s also a package for Pa; do your best to ensure that it arrives in Etten on Pa’s birthday.4 Perhaps you could add Felix Holt to it and read it after it’s been in Etten, that might be the best thing.
In the small roll addressed to you you’ll find 3 etchings after Jules Dupré, one for you, one for Uncle Jan van Gogh, with my regards, and one for Pa. Also for Pa a lithograph after Bodmer5 and an etching by Jacque, and then there’s a lithograph after Cabat for you. Cabat is a lot like Ruisdael, there are two magnificent paintings by him in the Luxembourg, one a pond with trees around it in the autumn at sunset, and the other the evening of a grey autumn day, a road by the waterside and a couple of large oak trees.6
That etching after Jules Dupré is beautiful, it’s one from an album of 6 with Dupré’s portrait.7 He has such a simple and noble face, it reminds me a bit of Mauve’s, though he’s older,8 and perhaps in reality he looks different from Mauve. 
&nbsp;1v:3 
It’s good that you’re taking English lessons, you won’t regret it.9
I’d like to send you a Longfellow10 and ‘Andersen’s fairy tales’,11 I’ll see if I can find them. If I do send them, read especially Longfellow’s Evangeline, Miles Standish, The baron of St Castine and King Robert of Sicily &amp;c.12
And now I’ll bid you good-day again and shake your hand in thought. Regards to everyone at the Rooses’ and if anyone else should ask after me, and believe me ever

Your loving brother
Vincent.

Give my regards again to my friend Borchers.

[Letterhead: Goupil Paris]

My dear Theo,
Thanks for your letter, write to me often, as I long for it these days.1 Write in more detail, too, and about everyday things; you see that I, too, am doing that more and more. I was interested to hear what you said about Boks, how he has arranged his studio and that you go there quite a lot.2 Do keep me well informed.
We sometimes feel rather lonely and long for friends, and think we’d be quite different and happier if only we found ‘it’, a friend of whom we would say, ‘this is it’.3 But you, too, will already have started to notice that there’s a lot of self-deception behind this, and that this longing, if we were to surrender to it too much, 
&nbsp;1r:2  would cause us to stray from the path. There are words that keep haunting me these days, they are the text for today: ‘His children shall seek to please the poor.’4
And now for some news, namely that my friend Gladwell is going to move. One of the employees at the printer’s has persuaded him to come and live with him; he had already tried to do this before. Gladwell has done it, I believe, without thinking. I’m awfully sorry he’s going. It will be soon now, probably at the end of this month.
For a few days now we’ve had a mouse in our ‘cabin’; that’s what we call our room, you know. Every evening we put some bread out, and it already knows how to find it.
I read the advertisements in the English newspapers and have already written to a couple, we’re hoping for a godsend. And now, regards to everyone at the Rooses’ and to any others who might ask after me, and do write again soon. Adieu. Ever,

Your loving brother
Vincent

If Mr Tersteeg should speak to you about me, write and tell me. Give my regards to His Hon. every time I write to you.

Paris, 2 February 1876.

My dear Theo,
Would you do me a great favour? You know that 15-cent edition of ‘Andersen’s vertellingen van de maan’, translated by the Rev. Ten Kate.1 Could you send me a copy of it when you get the chance?
It’s only tomorrow that a crate will be going to The Hague in which I’ll enclose the packages in question.2 The one for Pa can no longer arrive at Etten in time, but send it as soon as possible anyway. 
&nbsp;1r:2 
I still haven’t had a reply to various letters I wrote in response to advertisements. Nor did Uncle Vincent answer me.
I asked Mr Obach whether any people desiring information about me could apply to him, and His Hon. replied with a very kind letter. At any rate, old boy, we can only continue quietly with our eyes on Him whom we think of when we say ‘Who will shew us any good?’3
Adieu, regards to anyone who might ask after me, and ever

Your loving brother.

Paris, 7 February 1876

My dear Theo,
My hearty congratulations to you on the occasion of Pa’s birthday. It’s a beautiful text, the one for 8 February:1 Faithful is He that calleth you, who also will do it.2
What that it will be for our Father and for us we do not know, but in a sense we can leave that to Him whose name is ‘Our Father’3 and ‘I am that I am’.4
Today I received a letter in reply to one of mine; they asked whether I could teach French, German and drawing, and also requested a portrait. I’ll answer today;5 if I hear more I’ll write to you directly.
Thanks for the little book by Andersen, I’m glad to have it.6 It’s for reading aloud to a Dutchman, one of the employees I’ve been seeing 
&nbsp;1r:2  a lot of lately.7
Yesterday I went to an English church here, it was a nice experience to attend such an English service again, which has much that is simple and beautiful.
The sermon was on ‘The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me to lay down in green pastures, He leadeth me gently by still waters. He restoreth my soul and leadeth me in the paths of righteousness. Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil for Thou art with me, Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me. Surely Goodness and Mercy shall surround me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the House of the Lord for ever.’8
Thanks again for the little book by Andersen, and in thought a handshake, and regards to everyone at the Rooses’. I heard from home that Mr Tersteeg had been in Etten.9 In haste. Ever,

Paris, 19 February 1876

My dear Theo,
Thanks for your last letter, and also for the catalogue that was in the last crate.
Have I already thanked you for ‘Andersen’s vertellingen’, if not, then I do so now.1
I heard from home that you’ll be making the trip with the nouveautés in the spring, you’ll surely have nothing against that, it’s good experience and you’ll see lots of beautiful things during your trip.2 You’ll find Longfellow in the next crate. Gladwell was here yesterday evening – he comes every Friday – and we read some more of it. I haven’t read Hyperion3 yet, but have heard that it’s beautiful. 
&nbsp;1r:2 
These last few days I’ve been reading a beautiful book by Eliot, 3 stories, ‘Scenes of clerical life’.4
The last story, Janet’s repentance, I found especially moving. It’s the life of a curate who lives chiefly among the inhabitants of the dirty streets of a town.5 His study looked out over gardens with cabbage stalks &amp;c. and over the red roofs and smoking chimneys of poor cottages.6 For his midday meal he usually had badly cooked mutton and watery potatoes.7 He died at about the age of 34, and was nursed during his long illness by a woman who had previously been given to drink but, through his words and by leaning on him, as it were, had got the better of herself and found peace for her soul. And at his funeral they read the chapter with the words ‘I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live’.8
And now it’s already Saturday evening, the days 
&nbsp;1v:3  fly by here, and the time of my departure will soon be here. Still no answer from Scarborough.9 Regards, and in thought a handshake, and ever,

Your loving brother.
Vincent

Paris, 15 March 1876

My dear Theo,
Thanks for your last letter; thank Mauve and his wife for theirs, too, if you will, which I was glad to receive. I’m very eager to see the two paintings by M. that are going to the Salon.1
Gladwell may be coming back to his old room; he’s taking my place here in the gallery.
Is it also blowing up a storm like this in The Hague? Here for a few days already, almost continuously.
You should know that if nothing unforeseen happens I’ll go to Etten first. I’m thinking of leaving here on 1 April or perhaps 31 March. 
&nbsp;1r:2 
I hear from home that you’re also thinking of sping in Etten in the course of your trip.2 When are you leaving?
I hope I’ll get the chance to send you the Longfellow before you leave. It might be a good book to take along.
My time here is running out awfully fast, less than three weeks to go now. Meekness and longsuffering3 are also in my thoughts sometimes, every now and then.
Aunt Cornelie4 gave me a nice book to read, ‘Kenelm Chillingly’ by Bulwer.5 There’s much that’s beautiful in it. It’s about the fate of the son of a rich Englishman who can find no rest or peace among his peers and goes to seek it in other circles.
He nonetheless ends up returning to his own class, but doesn’t regret what he did.
And now, adieu, have a good trip, I wish you well and hope you see many beautiful things, in case you leave before my next letter arrives. Ever,

Your loving brother.

Paris, 23 March 1876

My dear Theo,
Herewith the book by Longfellow, it will no doubt become a friend of yours.
Today I responded to two more advertisements, I’ll go on doing it, even though most of my letters remain unanswered.
My time here is running out.
You’ll surely see many beautiful things on your trip;1 although a feeling for nature isn’t it, it’s nonetheless a wonderful thing to have; may it always remain with us.
And now you’ll be ‘boarding in many inns’,2 that’s also a singular pleasure at times. You know that I once went to Brighton on foot.3 I always think back on it with pleasure. Lodging-houses in England are often so pleasant, 
&nbsp;1r:2  Longfellow describes this well in Tales of the wayside inn.4
Gladwell is getting my place at the gallery; he’s there already, learning the ropes before I leave. I’ve seen quite a few paintings that are going to the Salon, including two very beautiful, large Gabriëls, a morning in the meadows, through the dew one sees a town in the distance, the other one was what we would call a watery sun.5
Also 2 large Xavier de Cocks, one of them an evening at the beginning of summer, a meadow surrounded by poplars; in the distance a farmhouse and fields and a girl bringing the cows home. In the foreground a pond, next to which 3 cows – a white one, a black one and a red one – lie in the grass; the sun has already set and the sky is pale yellow, the trees dark against it.6
I’m writing in great haste, as you’ll see from my handwriting.7 Have a good trip, and ever,

Your loving brother

Paris, 28 March 1876

My dear Theo,
A few more words, probably the last I’ll write to you from Paris.
I’ll probably leave here on Friday evening to be home on Saturday morning at the same time as at Christmas.1
Yesterday I saw around 6 paintings by Michel,2 how I wish you’d been there, sunken roads through sandy soil leading to a mill, or a man going home over the heath or sandy ground with a grey sky above, so simple and so fine. It seems to me that the pilgrims on their way to Emmaus3 saw nature as Michel does, I always think of them whenever I see one of his paintings.
At the same time I saw a painting by Jules Dupré, 
 &nbsp;1r:2  and a very large one at that.
As far as the eye could see, black marshy terrain, in the middle distance a river and in the foreground a pond (near it 3 horses). Reflected in both, the bank of white and grey clouds behind which the sun has set; on the horizon some greyish red and purple, the upper sky a gentle blue.4
I saw these paintings at Durand-Ruel’s. There they have no fewer than 25 etchings after Millet, and the same number after Michel, and masses after Dupré and Corot and all other artists, to be had for 1 franc apiece. That’s tempting indeed. I couldn’t resist buying a couple after Millet:5 I bought the last 3 of The evening angelus,6 and my brother will of course receive one when the opportunity arises.
I hear that Mr Iterson is coming to live at the Rooses’, he’s the youngest, I believe.7 Write again soon. Regards to everyone at the Rooses’ and to Mr and Mrs Tersteeg and to anyone who might ask after me, and in thought a handshake, and ever

Etten, 4 April 1876.

Dear Theo!
We’re happy that things are going well for you, and hope that the fine weather and new greenery are making your trip pleasant, but more than anything we wish you much success and are curious to hear about it. Vincent arrived home safe and sound on Saturday, we were glad he was here, and you can imagine how delighted we were to hear that on his last morning in Paris he was given the prospect of something. He’ll probably tell you about it; it’s the confirmation of the text for the day for his birthday.1 We can but hope, it’s certainly a long way off – but surely it’s pleasant to be by the sea, may he fare well, it should be possible. It’s wonderful that you’ll be seeing each other, and also Lies, who’s coming on Thursday. We’re awfully sorry that you didn’t see Aunt Mina, and we didn’t even hear how Vos is. Don’t you think it very sad, poor Kee and Uncle and Aunt, maybe the good weather will do some good.2 Vincent brought along 
&nbsp;1v:2  a lot of beautiful things to show us. Yesterday he and Pa went to Brussels. Pa is in the garden house even before the confirmation class, it’s going to be very charming in the garden. And now I’ll say goodbye and hope that you’ll still be coming on Saturday evening. Cor3 is taking piano lessons. It’s quite a task in the beginning. Goodbye, dearest Theo! Have a good trip – until Saturday. Ever:

Yours, your loving
Ma.

My dear Theo,
On the morning before my departure from Paris4 I received a letter from a teacher in Ramsgate5 who suggested that I come there for a month (without pay) in order to see whether he can use me at the end of that time.
You can imagine that I’m glad to have found something. I’ll receive free board and lodging in any case.
Yesterday I went with Pa to Brussels, Uncle Hein was really in a very sad state.6
In the train Pa and I talked a lot about paintings, including the paintings by Rembrandt in the Louvre7 and the portrait of Burgomaster Six,8 
&nbsp;1v:3  and also especially about Michel. Won’t there be a possibility for Pa to see that book about Michel?9 Think about it if the opportunity arises.
I’m so glad that I’ll see you, and Lies too, before my departure.10
Ramsgate, as you know, is a seaside resort. I saw in a book that it has 12,000 inhabitants, but don’t know any more about it than that.
And now, until Saturday. Have a safe trip, ever

Your loving brother
Vincent.

Gladwell brought me to the train last Friday evening. On my birthday11 he came in the morning at half past six already, and brought a very beautiful etching after Chauvel for me, an autumn landscape with a flock of sheep on a sandy road.12

Dear Theo!
It was a pleasure for us to receive your letter. Have an enjoyable trip. You’re lucky to have fairly good weather. We’re curious to hear what has happened in the meantime, and will be delighted to see you if you come this way.
Yesterday I went with Vincent to Brussels and back in one day. We also went to the cemetery in Laken,13 where I also went with you! 
&nbsp;1r:4  I thought of you so much. We’re glad that Vincent got something, and must wait and see what comes of it. May God guide him and you and all of us.14 Pain and disappointment also bring much that is good and comforting. The text for his birthday was, ‘The Lord will provide’.15

Ramsgate, 17 April 1876.

Dear Father and Mother,
  By now you’ve no doubt received the telegram,1 but will be wanting to know more particulars. I wrote down a few things in the train and am sending you that, so you can see how my trip went.2

Friday
We want to stay together today. Which would be better, the joy of seeing each other again or the sadness of parting?
We’ve often parted from each other already, though this time there was more sorrow than before, on both sides, but courage as well, from the firmer faith in, and greater need for, blessing. And wasn’t it as though nature sympathized with us? It was so grey and rather dismal a couple of hours ago.
Now I look out over rolling pastures, and everything is so quiet and the sun is setting behind the grey clouds and throws a golden glow across the land. How much we long for each other, those first hours after parting, which you’re spending in church and I in the station and the train, and how much we think of the others, of Theo, and of Anna and the other 
&nbsp;1v:2  sisters and of little brother.3
We just passed Zevenbergen, and I thought of the day you took me there and I stood on Mr Provily’s4 steps and watched your carriage driving away down the wet street. And then the evening when my Father came to visit me for the first time. And that first homecoming at Christmas.

Saturday and Sunday.
How much I thought of Anna on the boat; everything there reminded me of our journey together.5
The weather was clear, and on the Maas6 especially it was beautiful, also the view from the sea of the dunes, gleaming white in the sun. The last thing one saw of Holland was a small grey tower.
I stayed on deck until sunset, but then it grew cold and dismal.
The next morning in the train from Harwich to London it was beautiful to see in the morning twilight the black fields and green pastures with sheep and lambs, and here and there a hedge of thorn-bushes and a few large oak trees with dark branches and grey, moss-covered trunks. The blue twilit sky, still with a few stars, and a bank of grey clouds above the horizon. Even before the sun rose I heard a lark.
When we arrived at the last station before London the sun rose. The bank of grey clouds had disappeared and there was the sun, so simple and as big as possible, a real Easter sun.
The grass was sparkling with dew and night frost.
And yet I prefer that grey hour when we parted.
Saturday afternoon I stayed on deck until the sun was down. The water was quite dark blue as far as one could see, with rather high waves with white crests. The coast had already disappeared from view. The sky was light blue, burnished and without a cloud.
And the sun went down and cast a streak of dazzling light on the water. 
&nbsp;1v:3 
It was a truly grand and majestic sight, and yet simpler, quieter things move one so much more deeply, for now I couldn’t help shuddering, and thought of the night in the stuffy saloon with smoking and singing passengers.
A train was leaving for Ramsgate 2 hours after my arrival in London. That’s another train ride of around 4 1/2 hours.7 It’s a beautiful ride; we passed, among other things, a hilly region. The hills have a sparse covering of grass at the bottom and oak woods on the . It’s very similar to our dunes. Between those hills lay a village with a grey church covered with ivy like most of the houses. The orchards were in blossom, and the sky was light blue with grey and white clouds.
We also came past Canterbury, a town which still has a lot of medieval buildings, in particular a splendid church with old elm trees around it. Often, already, I’ve seen something of this town in paintings.
You can imagine how I sat looking out of the window, watching well ahead of time for Ramsgate.
I arrived at Mr Stokes’s around 1 o’clock. He was away from home but will be coming back this evening. During his absence his place was taken by his son (23 years old, I think), a schoolmaster in London.8
I saw Mrs Stokes9 in the afternoon at table. There are 24 boys between the ages of 10 and 14. (It was a fine sight, seeing those 24 boys eating.)
So the school isn’t large. The window looks out onto the sea.
After eating we went for a walk by the sea, it’s beautiful there. The houses on the sea are mostly built of yellow brick in a simple Gothic style, and have gardens full of cedars and other dark evergreen shrubs.
There’s a harbour full of ships, closed in by stone jetties on which one can walk. And further out one sees the sea in its natural state, and that’s beautiful.
Yesterday everything was grey.
In the evening we went to church with the boys. On the wall of the church was written ‘Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world’.10
The boys go to bed at 8 o’clock and get up at 6. 
&nbsp;1r:4 
There’s another assistant teacher, 17 years old.11 He, 4 boys and I sleep in another house close by, where I have a small room,12 which wants some prints on the wall.
And now enough for today, what a good time we had together, thank you, thank you for everything. Many regards to Lies, Albertine13 and little brother, and in thought a handshake from

Your loving
Vincent.

Thanks for your letters which just arrived; more soon, when I’ve been here a few days and have seen Mr Stokes.top

Ramsgate, 17 April 1876.

My dear Theo,
I arrived here safe and sound yesterday afternoon at 1 o’clock, and one of my first impressions was that the window of the not-very-large school looks out over the sea.
It’s a boarding school and there are 24 boys between the ages of 10 and 14.
Mr Stokes is out of town for a couple of days and so I haven’t seen His Honour yet, but he’s expected back this evening.
There’s another assistant teacher, 17 years old.
Yesterday evening and this morning we all took a walk by the sea. Herewith a bit of seaweed.1
The houses on the sea-front are mostly built of yellow brick in the style of those in Nassaulaan in The Hague (but taller), and have gardens full of cedars and other dark evergreen shrubs. There’s a harbour full of all kinds of ships, closed in by stone jetties running into the sea on which one can walk. And further out one sees the sea in its natural state, and that’s beautiful. Yesterday everything was grey.
I’m shortly going to unpack my trunks which have just been brought, and hang up some prints in my room. (The assistant teacher, 4 boys and I sleep in another house close by.)
It’s the holidays2 just now, so I haven’t had to give any lessons yet. I’m anxious to 
&nbsp;1v:2  see Mr Stokes. I must go out with the boys, adieu. Ever

Your most loving brother
Vincent.

Ramsgate, 21 April 1876

My dear Theo,
Enclosed you’ll find a Post office Order for 10 shillings;1 be so good as to place the enclosed advertisement for Anna for that amount in some newspaper or other, you decide which one.2 If it’s not enough I’ll send you the rest, and if it’s too much, buy some photograph or other for Etten, for 21 May. But in any event please tell me how much you pay for the advertisement; I do want to have the address as it may be of further use.
I hope so much that Anna will find something; Willemien will be going home soon now.3
Mr Stokes didn’t come back until today; he’s a rather large man with a bald head and whiskers. The boys seem to respect him yet love him all the same; he was already playing marbles with them, only a couple of hours after he got back.
We go to the beach often; this morning I helped the boys build a sand-castle like those we made in the garden at Zundert.
How much I’d like you to be able to look through the school window. The house stands on a square (all the houses around it are the same, which is often the case here). In the middle of the square a 
&nbsp;1v:2  large green, closed in by an iron fence and surrounded by lilac bushes. The boys play there during the midday break. The house where I have my room is on the same square.4
When I was in Rotterdam and saw that I’d have to wait there a long time, I very nearly came to The Hague, even went to the station. And yet I didn’t do it, I hope that later I’ll be able to see everyone and everything there again with a calmer eye.
Saying farewell at home on Good Friday is something I won’t forget. In the morning we went to  Hoeven5 together to attend church and the Lord’s Supper,6 and Father said there: ‘Arise, let us go hence’.7 And in the afternoon we did arise, and through the small window I saw Pa and little brother8 in the road, watching the train leave. And Sunday afternoon I was in the church in Ramsgate and was struck by the words written there on the wall,9 which you’ll find in Anna’s letter (enclosed for you to read, but send it back).
Enclosed is the advertisement in question.10 Regards to everyone at the Rooses’ and to anyone else who might ask after me, also to Borchers, if you run into him. Do you still go there now and then?
I shake your hand in thought, and ever

Your loving brother
Vincent

Do write soon.

A young lady, a clergyman’s daughter, having worked in England for some time, is looking for a situation as lady’s companion or nurse to a sickly lady.
Address: G.H.M.11 Post Office, Welwyn (Herts)12 (England).

Tell no one that you’re placing the advertisement. You can see from the letter that she’d prefer you didn’t.

Ramsgate, 28 April 1876

My dear Theo,
Many happy returns; my hearty congratulations on this day,1 may our love for one another only increase as we get older.
I’m so happy that we have so much in common, not only memories of the past but also that you’re working for the same firm I worked for until now, and therefore know so many people and places that I know too, and that you love nature and art so much.
You’ll have received that letter containing Anna’s advertisement in good order. There’s also an advertisement in the Daily News;2 now we can only hope that something will come of it.
Mr Stokes told me that he intends to move after the holidays – with the whole school, naturally – to a village on the Thames, around 3 hours from London. He would then furnish the school somewhat differently and perhaps expand it.
Now let me tell you about a walk we took yesterday. It was to an inlet of the sea, and the road to it led through the fields 
&nbsp;1v:2  of young wheat and along hedgerows of hawthorn etc.3 When we got there we had on our left a high, steep wall of sand and stone, as high as a two-storey house, on  of which stood old, gnarled hawthorn bushes. Their black or grey, lichen-covered stems and branches had all been bent to the same side by the wind, also a few elder bushes.
The ground we walked on was completely covered with large grey stones, chalk and shells.
To the right the sea, as calm as a pond, reflecting the delicate grey sky where the sun was setting. It was ebb tide and the water was very low.
Thanks for your letter of yesterday, I think it very nice that Willem Valkis will be joining the branch.4 Give him my particular regards. I’d like to walk with you both sometime through the Bosjes5 to Scheveningen.
Have a pleasant day today, and give my regards to everyone who asks after me, and believe me

Your loving brother
Vincent.


&nbsp;1v:3 
I wish you well today, old boy, and begin a happy and blessed year. These are important years for us both, years on which much already depends. May everything turn out well.
I’ll be glad when Anna has found something, but situations like the ones she is looking for are rather scarce. A sickly lady here who needed someone to look after her received 300 replies to her advertisement.
I shake your hand heartily in thought. Adieu!top

Ramsgate, 1 May 1876

My dear Theo,
Thanks for your letter, and for placing the advertisement. It would be good to place it again. The postal order was in the letter, wasn’t it?
The wind was blowing so hard here yesterday afternoon that Mr Stokes didn’t want the boys to go out. I asked permission anyway for 6 of the oldest boys and myself to go out for a walk. We went to the beach; the seas were high and it was difficult to walk against the wind. We saw the lifeboat being pulled by a steamboat, coming back from a ship that had been stranded on a sandbank a long way off;1 but they hadn’t brought anything back.
I know that painting by Willems very well;2 the drawing by Mauve you wrote about 
&nbsp;1v:2  must be beautiful.3 Do you ever go and see him in his studio?4
And now you ask what I have to teach the boys; chiefly French, fundamentals, one boy has started to learn German, and also a variety of things like sums, hearing them their lessons, giving dictations &amp;c. For the time being, then, giving the lessons isn’t so difficult, but it’ll be more difficult to make the boys learn them.
And now today is your birthday, I shake your hand in thought, and once again I sincerely wish you blessings and all the best.
Outside school hours, of course, the boys are pretty much under my supervision, and that takes up quite a lot of my time and will probably do so more and more. Last Saturday night I washed 6 or so of the young gentlemen; I did this for fun, though, and because it helped us to finish on time, not because I had to do it. I’ve also tried to get them to read, I have quite a few things that would be suitable for them, ‘The wide, wide world’5 &amp;c. &amp;c.
And now good-day, thanks for your letter, for placing the advertisement, and for sending the newspaper,6 and ever

Your loving brother
Vincent


&nbsp;1v:3 
One of these days you’ll be receiving a couple of English hymnals, I’ll mark a few of them. There is so very much that is beautiful in them. One grows very fond of them, especially when one has heard them here so often.
","-------------------------81 = 
 
Ramsgate, 6 May 1876

My dear Theo,
Herewith you’ll find the 2 books I promised you.1 I’ve marked a few things in them, but you’ll certainly find many beautiful things in addition to these. As I wrote to you already, though, one starts to grow especially fond of them when one lives in the country itself.
It’s already Saturday evening again; the weather’s beautiful today: the sea is very calm and it’s low tide at the moment, the sky is a delicate whitish blue with a haze in the distance. Early this morning it was also beautiful, everything was clear, where now it’s more or less hazy.
This town has something very singular, one notices the sea in everything; but you know this special quality, too, because one finds it in The Hague and Scheveningen as well. Did you know that Anna 
    &nbsp;1v:2  has received an answer to her advertisements? This week she sent me 3 letters she’d received. I’m longing to hear what she’s decided. One of the letters came from Amsterdam, a situation as companion to an old lady, another letter was from Vaals2 and yet another from here in England. She may have received even more since then.3
She seems awfully eager for an opportunity to come into contact with families; in Amsterdam she would find this at once through Uncle Cor and Uncle Stricker.4
Do you still visit Uncle Cor now and then? Sometimes I long to see him so much; just yesterday I wrote to him. Keep him as your friend, there can’t be any harm in that. Sometime you must tell Mr Tersteeg about the school here. These are really happy days, the ones I’m spending here, day 
&nbsp;1v:3  after day, and yet it’s a happiness and peacefulness that I don’t trust entirely, though one thing can lead to another.
A person isn’t easily satisfied, one moment he finds things far too good and the next he’s not satisfied enough. But I’m saying this by the by, we would do better not to talk about it, but rather continue quietly on our way. Have a good Sunday morning, and give my regards to everyone at the Rooses’, also to Mr and Mrs Tersteeg and Betsy, and in thought a handshake from

Your loving brother

Ramsgate, 12 May 1876

My dear Theo,
Thanks for your letter; I also like ‘Tell me the old, old story’1 very much. I first heard it sung in Paris, in the evening in a small church I used to attend sometimes. No. 122 is also beautiful. I regret not having gone to hear Moody and Sankey when they were in London.3 There’s such a yearning for Religion among the people in those big cities. Many a worker in a factory or shop has had a remarkable, pure, pious youth. But city life often takes away ‘the early dew of morning’,4 yet the yearning for ‘the old, old story’ remains, the bottom of one’s heart remains the bottom of one’s heart. In one of his books, Eliot describes the 
&nbsp;1v:2  life of factory workers &amp;c. who have joined a small community and hold religious services in a chapel in ‘Lantern Yard’, and he says it is ‘God’s Kingdom upon earth’,5 nothing more nor less.
And there’s something moving about seeing the thousands now flocking to hear those evangelists.
I think your plan to give Pa and Ma ‘After the departure’ by Sadée6 is very good; that’s agreed, then.
Willemien may be already there on 21 May. I see from your letter that you’re also thinking of going. Do it, old boy, if you can manage it. Sometimes such actions receive a special blessing. How it would surprise them.
There was something wistful in Ma’s last letter, in which she wrote a word or two about the necessity of our being so far from home. 
&nbsp;1v:3  And Ma’s eyes are hurting her again.
Come on, old boy, brighten them up again by being there on that day.
This afternoon Mr Reid7 sent me the catalogue of the exhibition in London.8
In thought a handshake, and congratulations on the birthdays of Lies and Cor,9 and also on 21 May. Regards to everyone at the Rooses’. In haste.

Your loving brother.
Vincent.

Ramsgate, 31 May 1876

My dear Theo,
Bully for you, being in Etten on 21 May, happily there were 4 of the 6 at home.1 Pa wrote to me in detail about everything that happened that day. Thanks, too, for your last letter.
Have I already written to you about the storm I saw recently? The sea was yellowish, especially close to the beach; a streak of light on the horizon and, above this, tremendously huge dark grey clouds from which one saw the rain coming down in slanting streaks. The wind blew the dust from the small white path on the rocks into the sea and tossed the blossoming hawthorn bushes and wallflowers that grow on the rocks.
On the right, fields of young green wheat, and, in the distance, the town with its towers, mills, slate roofs and houses built in Gothic style, and, below, the harbour between the 2 jetties running out into the sea, looking like the cities Albrecht Dürer used to etch. I also saw the sea last Sunday night, everything was dark grey, but day was beginning to break on the horizon. It was still very early, 
&nbsp;1v:2  and yet a lark was already singing. And the nightingales in the gardens on the sea-front. In the distance the light of the lighthouse, the guard-ship &amp;c.
That same night I looked out of the window of my room onto the roofs of the houses one sees from there and the s of the elms, dark against the night sky. Above those roofs, one single star, but a nice, big friendly one. And I thought of us all, and I thought of the years of my life that had already passed, and of our home, and the words and feeling came to me, ‘Keep me from being a son that causeth shame,2 give me Your blessing, not because I deserve it, but for my Mother’s sake. Thou art Love, beareth all things.3 Without your constant blessing we can do nothing.’
Herewith a little drawing of the view from the school window where the boys stand and watch their parents going back to the station after a visit.4 Many a boy will never forget the view from that window. You should have seen it this week when we had rainy days, especially in the twilight when the 
&nbsp;1v:3  street-lamps are being lit and their light is reflected in the wet street.
Mr Stokes was sometimes moody during those days, and when the boys were too boisterous for him it sometimes happened that they didn’t get their bread and tea in the evening. You should have seen them then, standing at the window looking out, it was really rather sad. They have so little apart from their food and drink to look forward to and to get them through the day. I’d also like you to see them going down the dark stairs and small corridor to table. On that, however, the friendly sun shines.
Another extraordinary place is the room with the rotten floor where there are 6 basins at which they wash themselves, with only a feeble light falling onto the washstand through a window with broken panes. It’s quite a melancholy sight, to be sure. How I’d like to spend or to have spent a winter with them, to know what it’s like.
The youngsters are making an oil stain on your little drawing,5 forgive them. 
&nbsp;1r:4 
Herewith a few words for Uncle Jan.6
And now good-night, if anyone should ask after me bid them good-day. Do you still visit Borchers once in a while? Give him my regards if you see him, and also Willem Valkis and everyone at the Rooses’. A handshake in thought from

Your loving

Welwyn, 17 June 18761

My dear Theo,
Last Monday I left Ramsgate for London. That’s a long walk indeed,2 and when I left it was awfully hot and it remained so until the evening, when I arrived at Canterbury. That same evening I walked a bit further until I came to a couple of large beeches and elms next to a small pond, where I rested for a while. In the morning at half past 3 the birds began to sing upon seeing the morning twilight, and I continued on my way. It was good to walk then. In the afternoon I arrived at Chatham, where, in the distance, past partly flooded, low-lying meadows, with elms here and there, one sees the Thames full of ships. It’s always grey weather there, I think. There I met a cart that brought me a couple of miles further, but then the driver went into an inn and I thought he might stay there a long time, so I walked on and arrived towards evening in the well-known suburbs of London and walked on towards the city down the long, long ‘Roads’. I stayed in London for two days and often ran from one end of the city to the other in order to see various people, including a minister to whom I’d written.3 Herewith a translation of the letter,4 I’m 
&nbsp;1v:2  sending it to you because you should know that the feeling I have as I start out is ‘Father, I am not worthy!’5 and ‘Father be merciful to me!’6 Should I find anything it will probably be a situation somewhere between minister and missionary, in the suburbs of London among working folk. Don’t speak about this to anyone, Theo. My salary at Mr Stokes’s will be very small. Probably only board and lodging and some free time in which to teach, or if there’s no free time, at most 20 pounds a year.7
But to continue: I spent one night at Mr Reid’s8 and the next at Mr Gladwell’s, where they were very, very kind. Mr Gladwell kissed me good-night and that did me good, may it be granted me sometime in the future to show some more friendship to his son every now and then. I wanted to leave for Welwyn that evening, but they literally held me back by force because of the pouring rain. However, when it had let up somewhat, around 4 in the morning, I set out for Welwyn. First a long walk from one end of the city to the other, something like 10 miles (each taking 20 minutes). In the afternoon at 5, I was with our sister and was very glad to see her. She looks well and you would be as pleased with her room as I am, with ‘Good Friday’, ‘Christ in the Garden of Olives’, ‘Mater Dolorosa’9 &amp;c. with ivy around them instead of frames. Old boy, when you read my letter to that minister you’ll perhaps say: he’sb not so bad after all, though in fact he is. Think of him as he is, however, every once in a while. A handshake in thought from

&nbsp;1v:3 
Rev. Sir.
A clergyman’s son, who, because he must work to earn a living, has no money and no time to study at King’s College,10 and who, besides that, is already a couple of years older than is usual for someone starting there, and has not even begun on the preparatory studies of Latin and Greek, would, in spite of everything, dearly like to find a situation connected with the church, even though the position of a clergyman who has had college training is beyond his reach.
My father is a clergyman in a village in Holland. When I was 11 years old I started going to school and stayed there until I was 16.11 At that time I had to choose a profession and didn’t know what to choose. Through the offices of one of my uncles,12 an associate in the firm of Goupil &amp; Co., art dealers and publishers of engravings, I was given a position in his branch at The Hague. I worked for the firm for 3 years. From there I went to London to learn English, and after 2 years from there to Paris. Forced by various circumstances to quit the firm, however, I left Messrs G.&amp;Co. and have since taught for 2 months at Mr Stokes’s school at Ramsgate. As my goal is a situation connected with the church, however, I must look further. 
&nbsp;1r:4 
Although I have not been trained for the church, perhaps my past life of travelling, living in various countries, associating with a variety of people, rich and poor, religious and not religious, working at a variety of jobs, days of manual labour in between days of office work &amp;c., perhaps also my speaking various languages, will compensate in part for my lack of formal training. But what I should prefer to give as my reason for commending myself to you is my innate love of the church and that which concerns the church, which has at times lain dormant, though it awakened repeatedly, and – if I may say so, despite feelings of great inadequacy and shortcoming – the Love of God and of humankind. And also, when I think of my past life and of my father’s house in that Dutch village, a feeling of ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son,13 make me as one of thy hired servants.14 Be merciful to me.’15 When I was living in London I often attended your church and I have not forgotten you. Now I am asking you for a recommendation in my search for a situation, and to keep a fatherly eye on me should I find such a situation. I have been left very much to myself; I believe that your fatherly eye could do me good, now that

The early dew of morning
has passed away at noon.16

Thanking you in advance for whatever you may be willing to do for me...

Isleworth.1

My dear Theo,
There may well come a time when I look back with a certain nostalgia on the ‘excesses of Egypt’2 connected with other situations, namely earning more money and being in many respects of more consequence in the world – this I foresee. There is however ‘bread enough and to spare’3 in the houses I’ll be visiting as I continue down the road I’ve taken, but not money to spare.
And yet I so clearly see light in the distance, and if that light disappears now and then it’s mostly my own fault.
It’s very questionable whether I’ll go far in this profession, whether those 6 years spent in the firm of Messrs Goupil &amp; Co., during which I should have been training for this situation, won’t always be a thorn in my flesh, as it were. 
&nbsp;1v:2 
I believe, however, that on no account can I turn back now, even if part of me should wish to (later, this isn’t the case now). These days it seems to me that there are no situations in the world other than those ranging from schoolmaster to clergyman and everything in between: missionary, ‘London missionary’4 &amp;c. &amp;c.
Being a London missionary is rather special, I believe; one has to go around among the workers and the poor spreading God’s word and, if one has some experience, speak to them, track down and seek to help foreigners looking for work, or other people who are in some sort of difficulty, etc. etc. Last week I was in London a couple of times to find out if there’s a possibility of my becoming one.5 Because I speak various languages and have tended to associate, especially in Paris and London, with people from the poorer classes and foreigners, and being a foreigner myself, I may well be suited 
&nbsp;1v:3  to this, and could become so more and more.
To do this, however, one has to be at least 24 years old, and so in any case I still have a year to wait.
Mr Stokes says he definitely cannot give me a salary, for he can get plenty of people who’ll work for board and lodging alone, which is certainly true. But can that be kept up for long? I’m afraid not; it will be decided soon enough.
But, old boy, no matter what the case, I think I can tell you this again, that these couple of months have bound me so closely to the sphere ranging from schoolmaster to clergyman, both through satisfactions associated with those situations and through thorns that have pricked me, that I can no longer turn back.6
Onward, then! But I can assure you that very distinct difficulties will present themselves very soon, and others are visible on the horizon, and as if one is in a different world from the firm of Messrs Goupil &amp; Co.
Will I be getting the small engravings (like those Pa and Ma have) of Christus Consolator and Remunerator7 that you promised me? Write soon if you can find a moment, but send your letter to Pa and Ma, because my address may change soon and Pa and Ma will be the first to know. 
&nbsp;1r:4 
Last week I was at Hampton Court to see the splendid gardens and long avenues of chestnut and lime trees where masses of crows and rooks have their nests, and also to see the palace and the paintings.8 There are, among other things, many portraits by Holbein which are very beautiful,9 and two beautiful Rembrandts (the portrait of his wife and one of a rabbi),10 and also beautiful Italian portraits by Bellini,11 Titian,12 a painting by Leonardo da Vinci,13 cartoons by Mantegna,14 a beautiful painting by S. Ruysdael,15 fruit by Cuyp16 and so on and so forth.
I rather wished that you could have been there too; it was a pleasure to see paintings again.
And I couldn’t help thinking vividly of the people who have lived at Hampton Court, of Charles i and his wife17 (she was the one who said ‘I thank Thee, God, for having made me Queen, though an unhappy Queen’,18 and at whose graveside Bossuet spoke19 from the abundance of his heart.20 Do you have ‘Bossuet, Oraisons funèbres’, you’ll find that eulogy there, there’s a very cheap edition, 50 centimes, I think),21 and also of Lord and Lady Russell, who would certainly have gone there often. (Guizot described their life in L’amour dans le mariage.22 Read that sometime if you can get hold of it.) Herewith a feather from one of the rooks there.
Do write soon if you can, I’m longing to hear from you, and believe me, after a handshake in thought

Your loving brother
Vincent

Despite my feeling that I am inadequate and that in many respects I lack the qualifications necessary for the situation I have and for the related situation I have my eye on, I nevertheless have at the same time such a feeling of thankfulness, of hope and of something like deliverance! and freedom! despite all kinds of bonds, and the thought of God – despite new shortcomings that occur to me – stays with me more strongly and longer.

c.o. – Jones Esqre
Holme Court1

My dear Theo,
Your letter and the prints came as a wonderful surprise this morning while I was weeding the potatoes in the garden. I thank you; the two engravings, Christus Consolator and Remunerator, are already hanging above my reading-desk in my room. God is just, so He will use persuasion to bring those who stray back to the straight path,2 that’s what you were thinking of when you wrote, may it come to pass. I’m straying in many ways, but there’s still hope. Don’t worry about your wanton life, as you call it, just go quietly on your way. You’re purer than I, and will probably get there sooner and better. 
Don’t have too great illusions about the freedom I have; I have my bonds of various kinds, humiliating bonds some of them, and this will only get worse with time; but the words inscribed above Christus Consolator, ‘He is come to preach deliverance to the captives’,3 are still true today. 
&nbsp;1v:2 
Now I have a request to make of you. Back then in The Hague I went to a catechist, Hillen, who was living in Bagijnestraat at the time.4 He took great pains over me and, although I didn’t show it, what he said made an impression on me, and I have a mind to write a word or two to him, perhaps it would give him pleasure.
Go and find him if you have the time and can discover his address, and tell him that I’ve become a schoolmaster and, who knows, may later find some kind of situation connected with the church. He’s a very modest man, one who has struggled a lot, I believe; sometimes when I went to see him and took a look at him I couldn’t help thinking that the end of that man will be peace.5
And give him the enclosed drawing6 for me.
How much I’d like to look in on Mauve sometime, what you describe, what you saw the evening you were there, I can picture clearly, as it were. Do write again soon, I wish you well, and believe me

Your most loving brother
Vincent.

Please give my regards to Mr Tersteeg and his wife and Betsy, and to everyone at the Rooses’, and anyone else you might see. Don’t tell them about me, though. Tell Jan and Piet7 I bid them good-day as well. As you see, I’ve ended up at the other school8 after all, herewith two prospectuses. If you can recommend the school to anyone wishing to send their boys to England, then do so.

Isleworth, 2 August 1876

My dear Theo,
I heard from home that you’d be coming home for a day while Anna and Lies were still there; write and tell me if that happened.
Mr Jones came home yesterday, and his family,1 I’d made the boys’ dining room green with Welcome home on the wall in holly and ivy and large bouquets on the table. There’s a lot of holly in the garden here, and a few old trees have had all their branches chopped off. These are now full of new branches, pure white or yellowish, with a small pink leaf here and there, which is absolutely beautiful, I picked a large bunch of them to put on the table.
Mr Jones asked me if I could find out how much 50 pounds of butter would cost in Holland; if it isn’t too expensive he’s thinking about always having it sent from Holland. Ask Mrs Roos about it sometime, and write and tell me as soon as possible.
The boys will also be coming soon.2
Have you ever read the story of Elijah and Elisha properly? I’ve been reading it again these last few days, and am enclosing what I’ve copied out.3 It’s so movingly beautiful. Similarly, I’ve also been reading in Acts about Paul, how he stood on the seashore, and they fell on his neck, and kissed him,4 and those words of Paul moved me, ‘God comforteth the simple’.5 It is God who makes men and who can enrich life with moments and times of higher life and loftier feeling. The sea may have made itself, or an oak tree itself, but men like Pa are purer than the sea. 
&nbsp;1v:2 
The sea is beautiful all the same; there were lots of bedbugs at Mr Stokes’s, but that view from the school window made one forget them.
The heart of a man of flesh and blood ‘sometimes faints from earnest longing’6 upon seeing those who devote themselves to and work for Him who baptized them, as it were, with the Holy Ghost, and with fire,7 and they – look, their eyes sometimes grow moist with tears of wistfulness as they think back on their young years and on ‘the good things with which He satisfied them’.8 Yet their exalted peace is better than the deceptive peace of bygone days. True rest and peace begin only ‘when there is nothing more in which to rest’9 and when there is ‘none upon earth they desire beside God’.10 Then there is a ‘woe is me’11 in them, and a beseeching ‘who shall deliver me from the body of this death’,12 and yet that is the best time of life, and blessed are they who reach that high peak.
I’ve heard two men say that, one in Paris, the Rev. Bersier,13 who, out of fear of a great bodily suffering that awaited him, exclaimed during his sermon, ‘Who shall deliver me of this dead body’ in a tone of voice that I believe made everyone in the church tremble. And I heard Pa say it (when I was home in April, in his sermon), but he said it in a soft voice, though it had a keener edge than the other, and he followed it with (and his countenance was like that of an angel) ‘the blessed above, they say “what you are now, I used to be: what I am now, you will one day be”’.14 
&nbsp;1v:3 
Between Pa and those above there is still a part of life, between us and Pa there is also still life. He above can make us Pa’s brothers and can also join us intimately to one another, more so every day, may it be so, for I have a need to remain your brother, old boy, surely you know how much I love you!
May I succeed and get some firm ground beneath my feet.
Yesterday I took a lovely walk along the Thames; on the other side there were splendid villas with their gardens. It was a sky like Ruisdael or Constable paint it.
And now a handshake in thought, give my regards to everyone at the Rooses’. How is Willem15 doing? And give my regards to Borchers, too, if you happen to see him, and believe me

Your loving brother
Vincent.


&nbsp;2r:4 
The word of the Lord came unto Elijah the Tishbite, saying, Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan. And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there. He so went and did according unto the word of the Lord: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan. And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.
And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land. And the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee. So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink. And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand. And she said, As the Lord thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse! and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die. And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son. For thus saith the Lord God of Israel, The barrel of 
&nbsp;2v:5  meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth. And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days. And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the Lord, which he spake to Elijah. And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him. And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son? And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed. And he cried unto the Lord, and said, O Lord my God! hast Thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son? And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the Lord, and said, O Lord my God, I pray thee, let this child’s soul come into him again. And the Lord heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived. And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth. And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of the Lord in thy mouth is truth.16


&nbsp;2v:6 
And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel? And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father’s house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the Lord, and thou hast followed Baalim. Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel’s table, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty. So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel. And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow Him: but if Baal is God, then follow him! And the people answered him not a word. Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the Lord; but Baal’s prophets are four hundred and fifty men. Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: And call ye on the name of your Gods, and I will call on the name of the Lord: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.  And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your Gods, but put no fire under. And they took the bullock which 
&nbsp;2r:7  was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us! But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made. And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a God; but he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked. And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them. And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.
And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down. And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the Lord came, saying, Israel shall be thy name: And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed. And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood. And he said, Do it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time, so that the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water. And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel! let it be known this day that Thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word. Hear me, O Lord, hear me, that this people may know that Thou art the Lord God! and that thou hast turned their heart back again. Then the fire of the Lord fell, and consumed 
&nbsp;3r:8  the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench. And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The Lord, he is the God; the Lord, he is the God. And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there. And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is a sound as of abundance of rain. So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the  of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees, And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times. And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man’s hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not. And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel. And the hand of the Lord was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.17

And Elijah went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O Lord! take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers. And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat. And he looked, and, behold, 
&nbsp;3v:9  there was a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again. And the Angel of the Lord came again the second time, and again touched him, and said, Arise and eat! because the journey is too great for thee. And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of the meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God. And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the Lord came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah? And he said, I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away. And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the Lord. And, behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks, going before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake: And after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice. And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave.18


&nbsp;3v:10 
And it came to pass, when the Lord would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal. And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the Lord hath sent me to Beth-el. And Elisha said unto him, As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee! So they went down to Beth-el. And the sons of the prophets that were at Beth-el came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace. And Elijah said unto him, Elisha! tarry here, I pray thee; for the Lord hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee! So they came to Jericho. And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the Lord hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on. And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan. And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground. 
&nbsp;3r:11 
And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me. And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.
And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.
And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father! my Father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces. He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan; and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the Lord God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over.19

‘And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified. I have coveted no man’s silver, or gold, or apparel. Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me. I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how He said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.’ And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all. And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul’s neck, and kissed him, Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more.20 top

Isleworth, 18 Aug. 1876

My dear Theo,
Yesterday I went to see Gladwell,1 who’s home for a few days. Something very sad happened to his family: his sister, a girl full of life, with dark eyes and hair, 17 years old, fell from her horse while riding on Blackheath. She was unconscious when they picked her up, and died 5 hours later without regaining consciousness.2
I went there as soon as I heard what had happened and that Gladwell was at home. I left here yesterday morning at 11 o’clock, and had a long walk to Lewisham, the road went from one end of London to the other. At 5 o’clock I was at Gladwell’s.3 I’d gone to their gallery first,4 but it was closed.
They had all just come back from the funeral, it was a real house of mourning and it did me good to be there.5 I had feelings of embarrassment and shame at seeing that deep, estimable grief, for these people are estimable. 
&nbsp;1v:2 
Blessed are they that mourn,6 blessed are they that are ‘sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing’,7 blessed are the pure in heart,8 for God comforts the simple.9 Blessed are they that find Love on their path, who are bound intimately with one another by God, for to them all things work together for good.10 I talked with Harry for a long time, until the evening, about all kinds of things, about the kingdom of God and about his Bible, and we walked up and down on the station, talking, and those moments before parting we’ll probably never forget.
We know each other so well, his work was my work, the people he knows there I know too, his life was my life, and it was given to me to see so deeply into their family affairs, I think, because I believe that I love them, not so much because I know the particulars of those affairs, but because I feel the tone and feeling of their being and life.
So we walked back and forth on that station, in that everyday world, but with a feeling 
&nbsp;1v:3  that was not everyday.
They don’t last long, such moments, and we soon had to take leave of each other. It was a beautiful sight, looking out from the train over London, that lay there in the dark, St Paul’s11 and other churches in the distance. I stayed in the train until Richmond12 and walked along the Thames to Isleworth, that was a lovely walk, on the left the parks with their tall poplars, oaks and elms, on the right the river, reflecting the tall trees. It was a beautiful, almost solemn, evening; I got home at quarter past 10.
Thanks for your last letter. You hadn’t yet written that Mrs Vintcent had died; how often I brought her home in the evenings.13 Do you still visit Borchers sometimes? How I’d like to have walked with you to Hoeven! I often teach the boys biblical history, and last Sunday I read the Bible with them. Mornings and evenings we all read the Bible and sing and pray, and that is good. We did that at Ramsgate, too, and when those 21 sons of the London markets and streets prayed ‘Our Father, who art in Heaven, give us this day our daily bread’,14 I’ve 
&nbsp;1r:4  sometimes thought of the cry of the young ravens that the Lord hears,15 and it did me good to pray with them and to bow my head, probably even lower than they did, at the words Do not lead us into temptation but deliver us from evil.16
I’m still full of yesterday; it must be good to be the brother of the man I saw so sorrowful yesterday, I mean that it must ‘be blessed to mourn’17 with manly sorrow, how I’d have liked to comfort the Father, but I was embarrassed, though I could talk to the son. There was something hallowed in that house yesterday.
Have you ever read ‘A life for a life’, I think in Dutch it’s called ‘Uit het leven voor het leven’, by the woman who wrote John Halifax?18 You’d find it very beautiful. How’s your English coming along?
It was a delight to take a long walk again, very little walking is done here at school. When I think of my life of struggle in Paris last year and now here, where sometimes I can’t leave the house for a whole day, or at least no further than the garden, then I sometimes think, when will I return to that world? If I do return to it, though, it will probably be some other kind of work than I did last year. But I think that I prefer doing biblical history with the boys to walking; one feels more or less safe doing the former.
And now, regards to everyone at the Rooses’, and if anyone else should ask after me. How are the Van den Berghs,19 and the Van Stockums on Buitenhof?20 Do you ever hear anything from them? A handshake in thought and best wishes from

Your most loving brother
Vincent

And herewith a letter for Mauve. You may read it, I believe it’s good not to forget one’s old acquaintances, that’s why I’m writing again to some of them, also those in Paris, to Soek and others.

  If you can persuade anyone to read Scenes from clerical life by Eliot, and Felix Holt, you’ll be doing a good deed. The former is a wonderful book.21 Recommend the former to Caroline and to the Mauves and, if possible, to Mr Tersteeg as well.

Could you write by return of post saying whether a Dutch pound of butter costs 80 cents and – if it’s a different pound – what part of a kilo is it then?22

Also give my regards to Mr and Mrs Tersteeg and Betsy.
  
I’m writing to you between school hours and rather in haste, as you can see.23

Isleworth, 26 Aug. 1876

My dear Theo,
Herewith a few words for Mr Tersteeg. The last time I wrote to him I was still in Paris and it’s time I wrote again; we’ve always kept in touch with each other since I left The Hague.1
  It’s a magnificent morning, the sun is shining through the large acacias on the playground, flashing on the roofs and windows visible behind the garden. There are already threads of gossamer in the garden, and it’s cool in the morning and the boys run back and forth to get warm. I hope to tell them the story of John and Theagenes2 this evening in their bedroom. I often tell them stories in the evening, such as Le conscrit by Conscience,3 and Madame Therèse by Erckmann-Chatrian4 and Oudejaar by Jean Paul,5 which is enclosed herewith, and Andersen’s fairy tales, ‘The story of a mother, The red shoes, The little matchseller’,6 King Robert of Sicily by Longfellow,7 etc. Sometimes something from Dutch history, too.
Every day I teach them biblical history, and that is something more than a pleasure.
Not a day goes by without praying to God and 
&nbsp;1v:2  without speaking of God, not only praying but also admitting to it, not only speaking but also holding fast to prayer, Father I pray not that Thou shouldest take me out of the world, but that Thou shouldest keep me from the evil.8 ‘O Lord, join us intimately to one another and let our Love for Thee make that bond ever stronger’.9
My speaking of Him is nothing much as yet, but with God’s help and blessing it will get better. I have confidence10 nowadays, but there is greater confidence than this, and greater Love and greater strength to act and to do what is right, a greater yielding to a stronger urge, a better and more profound searching for God and doing His will with a simpler, better and humbler heart, and that’s what I hope for.11
  Have I ever told you about that painting by Boughton, ‘The pilgrim’s progress’?12
It’s getting on towards evening. A sandy road leads over the hills to a mountain on which one sees the holy city lit by the sun setting red behind the grey clouds of evening.
On the road a pilgrim who wants to go to that city, he is already tired and asks a woman in black standing by the roadside whose name is ‘sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing’,13

‘Does the road go uphill then all the way?’
‘Yes to the very end’
‘And will the journey take all day long?’
‘From morn till night my friend’.14 
&nbsp;1v:3 

The landscape the road goes through is so beautiful, brown heathland with birches and pine trees here and there, and patches of yellow sand, and mountains in the distance, against the sun.
Actually, it’s not a painting but an inspiration.
I’m writing to you between lessons; today I escaped briefly and walked between the hedgerows with ‘John and Theagenes’ in order to memorize it. How I wish you could see the playground now, and the garden behind it, in the twilight, inside the school the gas-lamps flicker and one hears the congenial sound of the boys learning their lessons, from time to time one of them starts humming a snatch of melody from some hymn or other, and there’s something of that ‘faith of old’15 in me. I’m still a long way from being what I’d like to be, but with God’s help I’ll succeed. What do I want – – – to be bound to Christ with unbreakable bonds and to feel those bonds. To be sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing.16 To live in and for Christ, to be one of the poor in His kingdom,17 leavened with the leaven,18 inspired by His Spirit, constrained by His Love,19 resting in the Father with that rest of which I spoke in my last letter. To become one who cannot rest in anything but in Him, who desires nothing on earth beside Him,20 and who lives in the Love of God and of Christ, in whom we are intimately bound with one another. 
&nbsp;1r:4 
Gal. IV:6. And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father!

Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not Charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.
And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not Charity, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.
Charity suffereth long, it is meek, it is woe-spirited, it has woe and spirit, charity is kind; Charity envieth not; Charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things. For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known. And now abideth faith, hope, Charity; but the greatest of these is Charity.21

I know in Whom my faith is founded,
Though day and night change constantly,
I know the rock on which I’m grounded,
My Saviour waits, unfailingly.
When once life’s evening overcomes me,
Worn down by ills and strife always,
For every day Thou hast allowed me,
I’ll bring Thee higher, purer praise.22

May you also have a pleasant evening, may it be so. Thanks for your postcard. Mr Jones hasn’t yet decided what he will do.23 Give my regards to all who ask after me, in any case Borchers if you see him or any of his family. A handshake in thought from

Your most loving brother,
Vincent


&nbsp;2r:5 
Just a few more words. I just told the story of John and Theagenes – first in the room where most of the boys sleep and then in the room upstairs where there are 4 others – in the dark, but when I’d finished they had all fallen asleep unnoticed. It’s no wonder, because they ran around a lot today in the playground. Then, too, I speak with some difficulty and I don’t know what it sounds like to English ears. But I’ll learn by practice. I think that the Lord has received me24 just as I am, with all my shortcomings, although there’s an even deeper kind of receiving for which I hope.
It’s already late. Tomorrow evening I have to tell the same story to the assistant teacher and the two oldest boys, who stay up later. Those three and I eat our bread together in the evenings. When I was telling the story, 
&nbsp;2v:6  I heard one of them playing ‘Tell me the old, old story’ on the piano downstairs.25 It’s already late, and school rules don’t really allow me to stay up this long. Just now I smoked my pipe in the playground, it was so beautiful outside, even in the small yard where the pig lives for most of the year, though it’s not there at the moment. It’s nice to walk around like that everywhere in the evening, upstairs and downstairs. And now good-night and sleep well, and when you say your evening prayers, remember me as I do you. Good-night, old boy, a handshake in thought from

Your most loving brother
Vincent


&nbsp;3r:7 
I’m already looking forward to Christmas, two years ago we took that walk in the snow in the evening, do you remember it, when we saw the moon rise above Mariënhof?26 I still remember very well that evening at Christmas-time when I rode from Den Bosch27 to Helvoirt in an open cart, it was awfully cold and the road was slippery, how beautiful Den Bosch looked, the marketplace and the streets with snow and the houses dark, with snow on the roofs; Brabant is indeed Brabant, and the Mother country is indeed the mother country, and the lands where one is a stranger are the lands where one is a stranger.28 And how friendly Helvoirt looked that evening, and the lights in the village and the tower between the snow-covered poplars, seen from a distance on the road to Den Bosch. But it’s love that gives everything such great beauty and life. And do you still remember that trip to Sint-Michielsgestel?29


&nbsp;3v:8 
And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with great singing and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.30

A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not.31
Thus saith the Lord; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the Lord; and they shall come again from the foreign land.32

Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.33

For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are my ways your ways, saith the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts higher than your thoughts.34


&nbsp;4r:9 
When Lies came home at Christmas we had such a nice reunion. She and Albertien35 came from Breda36 in Uncle Vincent’s carriage. Pa, Cor and I walked up the road to meet them, and when we saw the carriage in the distance I walked on ahead. It was twilight, and dark in the carriage. Through the window one saw the road with rows of trees on either side, and the fields. At the end of the road the church, dark against the sky. Behind the church the large, dark evening clouds, dark but with silver edges. And it was so unexpectedly good for me to see the girl again; it was a much greater joy than I thought it would be.
Anna should be back in Welwyn by now,37 when she leaves Welwyn she’ll feel how much she loved it. You remember how in the winter she was the first to get up and make the fire. She’s been a blessing for that household. Her little room is so pretty, with the ivy 
&nbsp;4v:10  around the window and the view of the garden and the huge chestnut trees, which masses of swallows fly around in the summer when the sun goes down behind the trees. And the rooks have their nests there. The Mater Dolorosa by Delaroche38 was hanging above her bed.
Do you perhaps still have that page from Michelet that begins ‘from here I see a lady’?39 If you do, copy it for me if you will, I need it but don’t have the book any more.

A torrent of unrightousness
Has got the mastery of me
Oh my unbridled sinfulness
Thou dost atone in harmony!
Blest is he whom Thou hast chosen
From all earthly woe set free
Coming nigh, for Thou hast spoken
To find his dwelling-place in Thee.40

Blest is the man whose sins have been forgiven
Saved from punition in the sight of heaven
The transgression leading to his blight
Is hidden from the Lord’s most holy sight.
Blest is the man to whom it is allowed
To be judged blameless by a righteous God And nurtures in his heart sincere and pious
Pure probity and no base wickedness.41

How shall these things be?42

Who shall roll us away the stone from the sepulchre?43


&nbsp;5r:11 
I will go forth before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron.44

I am the First and the Last.45

Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget Thee.46

Hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine: Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again.47

For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee.48
The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but the Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light, 
&nbsp;5v:12  and thy God thy glory. Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself: for the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended.49

As one whom his Mother comforteth, so will I comfort you,50 saith the Lord. From this time thou shalt cry unto me, My Father, thou art the guide of my youth.51 Thou shalt call me, My Father; and shalt not turn away from me.52

Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved.53 Turn thou me, and I shall be turned.54

  For I am with thee, saith the Lord, to save thee,55 even if all thy lovers have forgotten thee.56 
  I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds.57

The Lord hath appeared of old unto me, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting Love.58 As one whom his Mother comforteth, so will I comfort you,59 saith the Lord. There is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.60

There is no safer or better way to get through life than Love, above all for our Father, in whose name we go forward from one day to the next, though we can feel love for others as well. How often has the memory of one who is already departed to our Father’s house where there are many mansions61 warmed me and made my heart glow with Love in the streets of London and on my evening walks in the cabbage fields outside the city. And still the thought of Him recurs and Love of Him, as often as I walk the streets of London.

My dear Theo,
Thanks for your letter of this morning. There are hours and days and times in life when God hides His face,1 as it were, but for those who love God even those times, those sorrowful times, are not entirely without God, but as though full of prophecies for the future and full of voices from the past: ‘hitherto hath the Lord brought you’,2 ‘foster again the faith of old’.3
If things should sometimes happen to you that you hadn’t counted on, strengthen within yourself the godly sorrow4 and the voice: ‘Abba, Father’.5
It was an autumn day and I stood on the front steps of Mr Provily’s school,6 watching the carriage drive away that Pa and Ma rode home in.
One could see that yellow carriage in the distance on the long road – wet after the rain, with thin trees on either side – running through the meadows. The grey sky above it all was reflected in the puddles. And around a fortnight later I was standing one evening in a corner of the playground when they came to tell me that someone was asking after me, and I knew who it was and a moment later I flung my arms round Father’s neck. What I felt, wouldn’t it have been ‘because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying in us, “Abba, Father”’?7 It was a moment in which we both felt that we have a Father in heaven; because my Father, too, looked up and in his heart there was an even bigger voice than mine crying ‘Abba, Father’.
&nbsp;1v:2 
Between that moment and today are years of pilgrimage.8 There are words that accompany us and grow up with us, as it were – which are, ‘sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing’.9 There is the prayer of a Mother for her children which is very powerful, for the prayer of a righteous person availeth much.10

Father, I pray not that Thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that Thou shouldest keep them from the evil.11

There is the hand of a faithful Father that blessed us when we left the family home.
And then, old boy, as I said earlier, there is a strong yearning for the day when He will no longer remember the iniquities of our youth.12 Who rejoices in grey hair?
As far as the east is from the west, so far do I remove your transgressions from you.13 Though your sins be as scarlet, I shall make them white as snow.14
He who hate not his own life, he cannot be Christ’s disciple.15 Pa once sent me this:

A longing for sanctification16

Who shall free us fully and for ever
From the body of this death, bent beneath the yoke?
How long must I still combat my nature
Ere this heart from sinful service be revoked?

That God my God would be, I pledged my troth
With singleness of mind Him would I follow
But I was tried – forgotten was my oath
  I was tempted – and my foot did falter.
&nbsp;1v:3 
No, with my own strength I shan’t learn to conquer
Soul, confess your weakness, self-deceit, take flight!
A child’s heart must be shaped by the Father
The Master be the pupil’s guiding light.

Well then, Father, let your love be my teacher
My Master, take my hand, and show your standard
I stood alone – and fell: now we’re together
I succumbed, but win behind your vanguard.

Only now do I feel strong, when with weakness stricken
Powerless in myself, but in the Lord, almighty!
Sin may tempt, the evil passions quicken,
Thou castest down all foes, O God in me!

I am grieved, but it’s a godly sadness
A night-cloud – tinged all round with dawn’s bright crimson
I weep, Lord, though my heart is full of gladness
I bow my head – but, Father, in thy bosom.

Who rejoices in grey hair? Who sees behind it as Felix Holt saw behind the word ‘failure’?17
  Who sees, when the first life, the life of childhood and adolescence, that life of joy in the world and vanity reluctantly withers, and it will wither, even as the blossom falls from the trees, that then another life shoots up vigorously, the life of the love of Christ that constraineth18 and godly sorrow not to be repented of;19 how then, in our profound dependence on God, and in the clear and forceful feeling of this, we find more favour in His eyes,20 which are too pure to behold evil,21 and how He will entrust to us more safely, in our weakness, His Holy Spirit which giveth life22 and constraineth unto good works.23 Who rejoices in the life ahead? Who rejoices in grey hair, who rejoices in sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing,24 chastened, but not killed until ‘dying, and, behold, we live’?25 Who rejoices in falling down, and standing up again with longsuffering and meekness?26 Who rejoices in the green of the pine trees and cedar and ivy and holly and moss in the winter? Dry wood gives more heat, bright fire and light when it is lit than green wood does. There is no fear in Love, but perfect love shutteth out fear.27
&nbsp;1r:4 
Father in my great affliction,
Father, who punishes and saves,
Father, e’en in death’s own kingdom,
Father, too, in the silent grave.
Where’er I see inconstancy,
God, Thou takest a firm stand.
My dust, too, rests in Thy loyalty
And slumbers in Thy fatherly hand.

Years, go quickly, fly by swiftly
With your gladness and travail
Whatever evil I bewail
God, my God, He changeth not.28

Though we sit in mournful darkness
That eternal light will blaze
All its glory and resplendence
Worthy of all laud and praise.29

I know in Whom my faith is founded,
Though day and night change constantly,
I know the rock on which I’m grounded,
My Saviour waits, unfailingly.
When once life’s evening overcomes me,
Worn down by ills and strife always,
For every day Thou hast allowed me,
I’ll bring Thee higher, purer praise.30

Why art thou cast down, my soul,
Disquieted in me, oh why?
Foster again the faith of old,
Rejoice in praising Him most high.
Oft hath He taken your distress
And turned it into happiness.
Hope in Him, eyes heavenward raised,
For to my God I still give praise.31

And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.32

The good Lord blesses love’s dwelling-place,
He dwelleth there, there one obtains His grace,
and life everlasting.33

Let us have Love toward one another, so that God may increase and strengthen our Love,34 and let us have love toward those around us, and if sometimes there are no people whom you can love enough, love the town you live in, as you certainly do, don’t I love Paris and London even though I’m a child of the pine-woods and of that beach at Ramsgate?
And seek to please the poor,35 and to find favour in their eyes.36
‘Stablish your heart’.37 ‘Because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying in us, “Abba, Father”’.38
He that hath not loved knoweth not God; for God is Love.39 And this is life eternal, to know God, and Christ, Whom He hath sent.40 There is no fear in love.41
In my Father’s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you.42
And yet I am not alone, but the Father is with me.43 It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man.44 It is better to fall into the hand of the Lord than into the hand of man.45
Let Christ be the centre of your longing, the Comforter of a troubled mind.46
‘Stablish your heart’47 in this sense, too: eat your bread with singleness of heart,48 I do so at least, I cannot do otherwise, God help me, if there be any danger in doing it; ‘Father, into thy hands I commend my heart’,49 eat your bread but live simply, and smoke your pipe, I do it too, whenever I have some tobacco and take a walk, I do it too whenever I get the chance to break loose. ‘And commit thy way unto the Lord; He shall bring it to pass’.50
&nbsp;2r:5 
‘Stablish your Love’. What exactly is the Love of which Paul speaks? What exactly are those wonderful words which you also know, 1 Cor. XIII.51 That Love is the life in Christ, that love is our Mother, all the goodness of the earth belongs to her, for everything is good if enjoyed with thanksgiving,52 but she extends much further than that goodness of the earth. To her belongs a drink from the brook during a walk or from a fountain in the hot streets of London and Paris, to her also belongs ‘I shall make your bed in sickness’,53 ‘as one whom his Mother comforteth, so will I comfort you’,54 to her also belongs faithfulness until death in Christ who gives us the strength to do all things.55 There is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.56
‘Stablish your hope’, for there is much that is good in life, for him who loves Christ the world is what it is, and all things shall be added unto him, as it were.57 It is indeed true that much joy already lies behind us, and also much that we used to look forward to, and although much joy may lie in store for us, we have already seen that ‘the world passeth away, and all the glory thereof’.58 And if it be true that:

I’ve found a joy in sorrow, a secret balm for pain,
A beautiful tomorrow of sunshine after rain;
I’ve found a branch of healing near every bitter spring,
A whispered promise stealing o’er every broken string.59

then it’s also true that there is no joy without insufficiency.
Sorrow is better than joy,60 and it is better to go to the house of mourning than to the house of feasts,61 for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.62
Even in mirth the heart is sad.63
For myself I shall endeavour to strive to love Christ and to work for Him in my life, even if it fails and even if I fall, there will always remain a standing aloof64 and a longing for above from the misery below. But I want to seek faith and Love and to continue asking for God’s spirit under all circumstances.
Now this is my vow to the Lord my God, my rock.65 If I am forsaken,66 then I am forsaken, but He is faithful and loves with an eternal Love and grants us our heart’s desire of being Evergreen. 
&nbsp;2v:6 
  Read the prophecies of Isaiah and Jeremiah, Isa. 9, 11, 35; Isa. 40, 42, 43, 44, 45:2 and the following verses, 49, 53, 55, 58, 61, 63, 65;67 Jer. 3, 17, 30, 31.
  
The Lord is thy keeper, The Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand.68 Unto Him belong the issues from death,69 with Him is everlasting life.70
My boy, days will come when we’ll no longer believe because we heard it said but when we’ll know, feel and love it. Then we’ll be moved71 to hear the name of God spoken, just as we’re moved to see our father again after a long time away from home.
And we’ll be brothers and sisters and children of the parsonage, as though made new, and in manifold ways.
Let us continue in life as long as our legs will carry us, even though our feet grow tired, and the oppression great, and even if our ears buzz with the sound of the world that they have been hearing for so many years, and even if our whole head is tired, and the going is difficult, let us continue in life because our Father and our Mother tell us to ‘go forth and don’t look back’, and if we can do good along the way,72 let us not neglect to do so; and yet it is more our heart than our work that God desires. Pa and Ma say ‘go forth’ and they love us, didn’t Pa say: my boy, surely you know that I would give my last shirt for you. Let us continue as long as our legs will carry us (and you will find that God giveth power to the faint; and increaseth strength to him that has no might,73 that God supports) for there is greater Love in store, that is why we rejoice and have faith in that life ahead.
A handshake in thought, it’s already late, adieu.

Your most loving brother,
Vincent

Now, Brother, these are the fruits of my pen and the fruits of my heart.

My eyes, O weep no more, but hold back your tears
My soul, grieve no more, but pray, but pray,
my soul.74

Do you ever go to the Lord’s Supper?75 They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.76

(Try and send that page from Michelet.)77

Don’t be afraid, when you’re out walking in the evening and there’s no one near by, to sing a psalm: ‘The panting hart, the hunt escapèd’,78 or ‘O why art thou cast down, my soul?’79 or ‘Centre of our longing’80 or ‘I know in Whom my faith is founded’.81

The years between 20 and 30 are full of all sorts of dangers, full of great danger, yea, the danger of sin and death, but also full of light and God’s comfort. Wrestling, you will emerge victorious,82 and when they’re over you’ll think back on them with nostalgia and say, it was a good time after all.

Regards to everyone at the Rooses’, Haanebeeks’, Tersteegs’, Borchers’, Caroline83 and Mauve.

If you can, send a Carte de visite to Ma on her birthday, No. 669, The prodigal son by Scheffer.84

My dear Theo,
Van Iterson just came and surprised me, I think it’s nice that he came, but it’s as though he were a person from another world, so much lies between the time when we were in the firm together and now.
Herewith the ‘Wijde wijde wereld’1 and another little book,2 give one of them to Caroline.3
How much I’d like you to be able to see it here.
I hope to walk to London on Saturday morning at 4 o’clock to visit Gladwell4 and others. I wish you could walk along with me.
A hearty handshake in thought. Adieu, believe me,

Your most loving brother
Vincent

Isleworth, 3 October 1876.

Sometimes hearts that are drooping
Grow full to the o’erflowing
And they that behold it
Do wonder and know not
That God at their fountains
Far off has been raining.1

Dear Theo,
I heard from home that you were ill.2 How much I’d like to be with you, my boy. Yesterday evening I walked over to Richmond and I thought about you the whole way, it was a beautiful, grey evening, you know that I go there every Monday evening to the Methodist church,3 yesterday evening I even said a few words on ‘Nothing pleaseth me but in Jesus Christ, and in Him all things please me’.4
How I’d like to be with you, though, oh why are we all so far apart? But what shall we do about it?
I’m sending herewith a letter from the aunts at Zundert. You know that Aunt Bet hurt herself so badly.5 I wrote and told them that, if possible, you and I would walk to Zundert sometime at Christmas.
Herewith I’m copying out a few psalms, you might like to read them at this time. Write a few words soon if you can.
A week ago on Saturday I made a long journey to London, and there I heard about a situation that might be of future interest. The clergymen in such seaside places as Liverpool and Hull, for example, often have need of assistants who speak various languages to work among the seamen and foreigners, and also to visit the sick. In addition, such a situation would be salaried.
I left here early that morning, 4 o’clock, that night it was beautiful in the park here,6 with the dark avenues of elm trees and the wet road going through them and the grey rainy sky above it all, and there was a thunderstorm in the distance. When daylight came I was in Hyde Park, where the leaves were already falling from the trees and the Virginia creeper was so magnificently red against the houses, and it was foggy. At 7 o’clock I was in Kennington, and rested there 
&nbsp;1r:2  awhile in the church I had attended many a Sunday evening.7 In London I visited one or two people and also went to the gallery of Messrs Goupil &amp; Cie, and there I saw the drawings that Van Iterson had brought, and it was a pleasure to see the Dutch cities and meadows again. That painting by Artz, that mill on the canal,8 I find really very beautiful. You also have a good life ahead of you, Theo, remain steadfast, and much light will come your way. Is Van Iterson back yet? I was very glad indeed to see him again, he’s bringing you ‘De wijde wijde wereld’,9 read it one of these days, the first chapters in particular are so beautiful and so truly straightforward.10 And read Longfellow sometime, e.g.:

I see the lights of the village
Gleam through the rain and the mist
And a feeling of sadness comes o’er me
That my soul cannot resist

A feeling of sadness and longing
That is not akin to pain
And resembles sorrow only
As the mist resembles the rain

Come read to me some poem
Some simple and heartfelt lay
That shall soothe this restless feeling
And banish the thoughts of day.

Not from the grand old masters
Not from the bards sublime
Whose distant footsteps echo
Through the corridors of time

Read from some humbler poet,
Whose songs gushed from his heart
As showers from the clouds of summer
Or tears from the eyelids start.

Who through long days of labour
And nights devoid of ease,
Still heard in his soul the music
Of wonderful melodies

Such songs have power to quiet
The restless pulse of care
And come like the benediction
That follows after prayer.11

Why art thou cast down, my soul,
Disquieted in me, oh why?
Foster again the faith of old,
Rejoice in praising Him most high.
Oft hath he taken your distress
And turned it into happiness.
Hope in Him, eyes heavenward raised,
For to my God I still give praise.12

If Van Iterson gave you that English hymnal, read No. 14.13
And now, old boy, a handshake in thought to you and one to Uncle Jan, adieu, old boy, remain steadfast and get well soon, and write soon about how you’re doing and at the same time send back the aunts’ letter, poor Aunt Bet, what old friends we are. Oh that Zundert, the thought of it’s almost too much at times. Adieu, old boy, may God make us brothers more and more and join us intimately to one another, and may the Love for Him make that bond ever stronger.14 Give my very warm regards to Uncle Jan, I heard from Pa that Willem and Johan15 are doing very well indeed. Give my regards, too, to everyone at the Rooses’, from

Your most loving brother,
Vincent.

Paris will also be beautiful now in the autumn, last year Gladwell and I went every Sunday to as many friends and churches as we could, we left in the morning and came home late. Notre-Dame is so absolutely beautiful in the autumn evenings among the chestnut trees. There’s something in Paris, though, that’s more beautiful than the autumn and the churches, and that is the poor people there. I sometimes think of many a person there. 
&nbsp;1v:3 

Psalm 23
  
The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul: He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name’s sake.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for Thou art with me; Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me: Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: And I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.

Psalm 91
  
He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust. Surely He shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with His wings, and under His wings shalt thou trust: His truth shall be thy shield and buckler. Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee. Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked. Because Thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the most High, Thy habitation;
There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. For He shall give his angels charge to keep thee in all thy ways. They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone. Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.
Because he hath set his love upon Me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known My name. He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.
With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.


&nbsp;1v:4 
Psalm 121
  
I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.
My help cometh from the Lord, which made Heaven and earth. He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber.
Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.
The Lord is thy keeper: the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand.
The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.
The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul.
The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore.

A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not.
Thus saith the Lord; Refrain thine eyes from tears, and thy voice from weeping, for thy work shall be rewarded, and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.16 But this shall be the covenant that I will make, saith the Lord, I will write my law in their inward parts, and will be their God, and they shall be My sons and daughters. And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know Me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.17

I know in Whom my faith is founded,
Though day and night change constantly,
I know the rock on which I’m grounded,
My Saviour waits, unfailingly.
When once life’s evening overcomes me,
Worn down by ills and strife always,
For every day Thou hast allowed me,
I’ll bring Thee higher, purer praise.18

Father in my great affliction,
Father, who punishes and saves,
Father, e’en in death’s own kingdom,
Father, too, in the silent grave.
Where’er I see inconstancy,
God, Thou takest a firm stand.
My dust, too, rests in Thy loyalty
And slumbers in Thy fatherly hand.19
Though catastrophes come hither,
Refuge I shall find in thee.
Thou art in Thy Son my Father,
Constant shalt Thou ever be.20

The light of stars.21

The night is come but not too soon;
And sinking silently,
All silently the little moon
Drops down beneath the sky.

There is no light in heaven and earth
But the cold light of stars;
And the first watch of night is given
To the red planet Mars.

Is it the tender star of love?
The star of love and dreams?
Oh no, from that blue tent above,
A hero’s armour gleams

And earnest thoughts within me rise,
When I behold afar,
Suspended in the evening skies,
The shield of that red star

O star of strength, I see thee stand
And smile upon my pain
Thou beckonest with thy mailed hand
And I am strong again

Within my breast there is no light,
But the cold light of stars;
I give the first watch of the night
To the red planet Mars.

The star of the unconquered will,
He rises in my breast
Serene and resolute and still,
And calm and selfpossessed.

And thou, too, whosoe’er thou art
That readest this brief psalm
As one by one thy hopes depart
Be resolute and calm.

O fear not in a world like this
And thou shalt know ’ere long
Know how sublime a thing it is
To suffer and be strong.

The panting hart, the hunt escapèd,
Cries no harder for the pleasure
Of fresh flowing streams of water
Than my soul doth long for God.
Yea, my soul thirsts for the Lord,
God of life, oh when shall I
Approach Thy sight and drawing nigh,
Give Thee praise in Thine own house.22

Do read Isaiah 53.

Isleworth, 7 Oct. 1876.

Dear Theo,
It’s Saturday again, and I’m writing a few words once more. I’m longing so much to see you again, oh, I can long for it so much sometimes. Do write soon and tell me how you are.
Last Wednesday afternoon we took a lovely walk to a village an hour away from here. The road there goes through meadows and fields, along hedgerows of hawthorn full of blackberries and clematis and here and there a tall elm tree. It was so beautiful when the sun went down behind the grey clouds and when the shadows were long, and we chanced to meet Mr Stokes’s school,1 where there are still several boys I know.
The clouds kept their red glow long after the sun had set and the twilight was gathering over the fields, and in the distance we saw the street-lamps being lit in the village. This morning there was also a beautiful sunrise. I see it every morning when I wake the boys up.
Last night I opened that book by Souvestre again (Le philosophe sous les toits),2 and I found such a friendly description of Paris in it, a kind description; I copied it out for Pa and Ma, perhaps you’ll like it too:

9 May. The beautiful evenings have returned; the trees are beginning to uncurl their buds. Hyacinths, daffodils, violets and lilacs scent the flower-sellers’ stalls; the crowds have begun to stroll along the quays and boulevards again. After supper, I too came down from my garret to breathe the evening air. 
&nbsp;1v:2 
It is the hour when Paris shows herself in all her beauty. During the day, the plaster of the facades fatigues the eye with its monotonous whiteness, the heavily laden carts make the cobblestones shudder under their huge wheels, the hurrying crowds cross and collide, intent on not missing a moment of business; there is something harsh, anxious, breathless about the city. But everything changes the moment the stars come out; the white houses fade into misty shadow; nothing is to be heard but the wheels of carriages as they bowl along on their way to some party or other; nothing is to be seen but people strolling idly or gaily by; work gives way to leisure. Now everyone draws breath from that fierce race through the day’s activities; what strength remains is given over to pleasure! See the dance-halls lighting up their colonnades, the theatres opening, the tit-bit stalls lining the avenues, the newsvendors making their lanterns shine. Paris has clearly put aside the pen, the ruler and the apron; after the day dedicated to work it wants to keep the evening for enjoyment; like the masters of Thebes it has put off serious business till the morrow. I love to share this festive time — not to take part in the general gaiety but to observe it. The joy of others may embitter jealous hearts, but it fortifies submissive hearts; it is the ray of sunshine that opens up those two lovely flowers called ‘confidence’ and ‘hope’.

Usually, the view that opens before my window delights me. It is a clutter of roofs whose s overlap and criss-cross, superimposed on one another, and upon which the tall chimneys raise their peaks. Yesterday I still found something Alpine about them, and waited for the first snow, to see glaciers on them; today I see nothing but tiles and stovepipes. The pigeons that fed my rustic fantasies now seem no more than poor feathered creatures that have taken the roofs for a farmyard; the smoke that rises in faint wisps, instead of giving me dreams of the vent-holes of Vesuvius makes me think of cooking and dish-water; lastly, the telegraph that I can see from afar, on the old tower of Montmartre, looks to me like a revolting gallows whose arm rises above the city.3

In sorrow did I bow my head
There is no peace on earth I said
The world is strong
And mocks the song
Of ‘peace on earth, Goodwill to men’!

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:
‘God is not dead! nor doth He sleep!
What’s wrong shall fail
What’s right prevail
With peace on earth, goodwill to men.’4

There’s still a lot to do here for many to whom God gives His blessing and whose lives He spares.5
&nbsp;1v:3 
While I was writing to you I was summoned to Mr Jones, who asked if I felt like walking to London for him to collect some money. And when I returned in the evening, happily there was a letter from Pa with news of you! How I’d like to be with you, with Pa and with you,6 old boy. And thank God you’re a little better, even though you’re still weak. And you’ll be longing to see Ma too, and now that I hear you’re going home with Ma it makes me think of a passage in Conscience:
  
I have been ill. My spirit was weary, my soul disenchanted, my body sickly. I, whom God has at least endowed with moral energy and a vast instinct for affection, was falling into the depths of the bitterest discouragement, and I felt with terror a deadly poison creeping into my shrivelled heart. I have spent three months on the heath: you know, that lovely region where the soul returns to itself and enjoys sweet repose; where everything exudes peace and tranquillity; where the soul, in the presence of God’s immaculate creation, shakes off the yoke of convention, forgets society and frees itself from its bonds with the vigour of returning youth; where every thought takes on the form of prayer; where the heart is emptied of everything that is not in harmony with the freshness and freedom of nature. Oh, there the weary soul finds calm; there, the exhausted man regains a youthful strength. Thus were my days of sickness spent, days of ineffable joy for my soul: smiling at the sun when, in all its majesty, it casts its first rays over the horizon; watching the countryside awaken and catching the first notes of the glorious hymn it addresses to heaven; roaming heaths and forests; questioning my soul — and thinking — scrutinizing and admiring the life of plants and animals, taking deep breaths of the pure air, stopping, going on, turning back, and talking out loud in the solitude; dreaming of splendid things: of God, of the future, of our dear Flanders, of peace and love. And in the evening! To sit under the wide chimney-piece, feet in the ashes, eyes fixed upon a star that sends me its light from on high through the chimney-top, as if calling out to me; or, sunk in a vague reverie, to look at the fire, watching the flames come to life, grow, gasp and crackle, pushing each other aside as if vying to lick the cooking-pot with their tongues of fire — and to imagine that this is human life: to be born, to work, to love, to grow up, and to die.... Up above, smoke crowns the chimney with its weightless plume; of all that noise, that crackling, that heat, nothing more comes forth.7

Mr Jones has promised me that I won’t have to teach so much any more, but that I may work in his parish from now on, visiting people, talking to them, and so on. May God give this His blessing. Father, I pray that Thou dost not take me out of the world, but that Thou shouldest keep me from the evil.8 
&nbsp;1r:4 
Now I’ll tell you about my walk to London. I left here at noon and arrived where I had to be between 5 and 6 o’clock and posted the letter to Pa and Ma along the way.
  When I came to the neighbourhood in the city where most of the galleries are, in the neighbourhood of the Strand, I met a lot of acquaintances; it was right at lunch-time and so there were a lot of people on the street, coming from or going to their offices. First of all, I met a young clergyman who used to preach here and with whom I became acquainted at that time, then Mr Wallis’s clerk and then one of the Messrs Wallis himself, in those days I went to their house once or twice – he already has two children9 – and then I ran into Mr Reid10 and Mr Richardson,11 who are old friends by now. Last year at this time Mr Richardson was in Paris, and we walked together to Père Lachaise.12 Afterwards I went to see Van Wisselingh, where I saw sketches for two church windows.13
In the middle of one of the windows the portrait of an elderly lady, such a noble face, with the words ‘Thy will be done’14 inscribed above; in the other window the portrait of her daughter, with the words ‘Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen’.15 There, as well as in the gallery of Messrs G.&amp;Cie,16 I saw beautiful paintings and drawings, it’s such a deep pleasure to be reminded time and again of Holland through art.
In the City17 I also went to see Mr Gladwell18 and to St Paul’s. And from the City to the other end of London, there I visited a boy who had left Mr Stokes’s school because of illness, and I found him completely recovered, outside in the street. Then on to the place where I had to collect the money for Mr Jones. The suburbs of London have a peculiar beauty; between the small houses and gardens there are open places covered with grass and usually with a church or school or poorhouse between the trees and shrubbery in the middle, and it can be so beautiful there when the sun goes down red in the light evening mist. It was like that yesterday evening, and later I did so wish that you had seen the streets of London when it began to grow dark and the street-lamps were lit and everyone was going home, it was obvious from everything that it was Saturday evening, and in all that hustle and bustle there was peace, one felt, as it were, the need for and joy at the approach of Sunday. Oh those Sundays and how much is done and striven for on those Sundays, it’s such a relief to those poor neighbourhoods and busy streets. It was dark in the City, but it was a lovely walk past all those churches along the way. Close to the Strand I found an omnibus that brought me a long way, it was already rather late. I rode past Mr Jones’s little church19 and saw another in the distance where light was still burning so late. I headed for it and found it to be a very beautiful little Roman Catholic church20 in which a couple of women were praying. Then I came to that dark park I already wrote to you about,21 and from there I saw in the distance the lights of Isleworth and the church with the ivy and the cemetery with the weeping willows on the banks of the Thames. 
&nbsp;1r:5 
Now then, Theo, get well soon and read this letter sometime when Ma is sitting with you, because I’d very much like to be with you both in thought. I’m really very glad that Mr Jones has promised to let me work in his parish, and that I’ll eventually find the right thing. We must seek that, but God must help and that He does, there is no life that He cannot sanctify and inspire. May I also discover ‘that this is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ came into the world to save sinners’,22 being useful and of some value.
I long so much to see you sometimes. A hearty handshake to you, and give Ma your hand for me when she’s sitting with you. Adieu.

Your most loving brother,
Vincent

Adieu. May God grant that I find grace in the eyes of my Father and Mother and in the eyes of those who will come after me. And now, my boy, another word to you. He who puts himself in a Christian sphere, and seeks and does Christian work as best he can, he will soon feel that he is on a path that he must traverse whether he wants to or not, and will cry out in anguish, God help me, I can do nothing else, and God hears this cry and God is a more powerful help in life than all human and worldly help. 
&nbsp;1v:6 

Psalm 107

O Give thanks unto the Lord, for His mercy endureth forever. Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, whom He hath redeemed. They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in. Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and He delivered them out of their distresses. And He led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.
He brought them out of darkness, and brake their bands in sunder. For He hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder. He sent His word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.
They that go down to the sea in ships, these see the great works of the Lord, and His wonders in the deep.
For He commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof. They mount up to the Heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble. They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit’s end. Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, and He bringeth them out of their distresses. He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still. Then are they glad because they be quiet; so He bringeth them unto their desired haven.
He setteth the poor on high. The righteous shall see it, and rejoice.23

Man proposes, but God disposes.24

Protect me O God, for my bark is so small and Thy sea is so great.25

Only they that brave its dangers know the secret of the sea, understand its mystery.26

I hope to receive tomorrow, for the second time, some money for my new work, and to buy a pair of new boots and a new hat with it. And then, God willing, we shall ‘rise up once again’.27

Many regards to everyone at the Rooses’ and to everyone I know, especially everyone at Mr Tersteeg’s and at the Van Stockums’ and the Haanebeeks’. Tell Ma that it was such a delight, after that journey to London, to put on a pair of socks that she’d knitted.

In the streets of London they’re selling sweet violets everywhere; they flower here twice a year. I bought some for Mrs Jones to make up for the pipe I smoke here now and then, mostly late in the evening in the playground. The tobacco here is rather strong, though.top

Isleworth, 13 October 1876

Dearest Mother and Theo,
The boys will be going home tomorrow and then I’ll get my money. I asked Mr Jones to let me go and see you in these three days, my heart is so much with you. It now depends on you two, if you say, ‘you may come’, then Mr Jones will let me go. Besides wanting so much to sit at Theo’s bedside, I should also like so very much to talk to my Mother, and if possible to go to Etten once more to see and speak to my Father again. It would be but a short visit, I could stay with you one or two days.
Last Monday I was in Richmond again and took as my text1 ‘He hath sent me to preach the gospel to the poor’.2 But he who wants to preach the gospel must first have it in his own heart, oh, that I might find it, for it is only the words spoken in singleness and from the abundance of the heart3 that can bear fruit.
One of these days, perhaps, I’ll go to London or Lewisham again.4
I just gave Mr Jones’s girls5 a German lesson, and after the lesson I told them Andersen’s story The snow queen.6
If you can, write and tell me by return of post if I may come. I was glad to have Ma’s last letter. 
&nbsp;1v:2 
I hope to visit Mr Stokes’s school one of these days. And then I hope to buy a new pair of shoes to prepare myself. The view from the window in your room is no doubt beautiful now, I know it from days past, you know.
We’re having a lot of rain here; it’s probably the same where you are.
I’ll have two or three weeks around Christmas to go to Holland, should Anna be able to come as well we could perhaps travel together. And now we’re gradually heading towards winter again, make sure you’re completely better when it arrives. It is indeed wonderful that Christmas falls in the winter. Oh how I’m looking forward to it, old boy, to make my rounds here and there at Turnham Green when it’s cold.7 When I think of you like this, as of ‘one whom his Mother comforteth and who is worthy of being comforted by his Mother’,8 it is with envy. Do get well soon, in any case.
Yesterday I asked Mr Jones to let me go, but he didn’t want to give his consent and said at last, write to your Mother, if she thinks it’s all right then so do I.
It is indeed a beautiful poem, that one by De Génestet:
  
On the lofty heights of suffering,
Steep the path to the Holy Land,
Steep the path one upward strives,
Steep the path to better lives.
On these lofty heights of suffering,
Led by God’s own loving hand.
From their peaks – it did seem nearer
To the starry, holy sphere,
And the dwelling of the Father –
Down upon the world I peered.
And yet I thought of that one morning,
Of a morning long ago,
When I, laughing without caring,
Glimpsed, O Lord, Thy world below.9


&nbsp;1v:3 
And now I’ll copy out something for my brother:

I love the Lord, because He hath heard my voice and my supplications. Because He hath inclined His ear unto me, therefore will I call upon Him as long as I live.
The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow. Then called I upon the name of the Lord; O Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul. Gracious is the Lord, and righteous; yea, our Lord is merciful. The Lord preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and He helped me. Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee. For Thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling. I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living. I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted: I said in my haste, all men are liars. What shall I render unto the Lord for all His benefits toward me? I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord. I will pay my vows unto the Lord. O Lord, truly I am Thy servant; a son of Thine handmaid: Thou hast loosed my bonds. I will offer to Thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the Lord. I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all His people, in the courts of the Lord’s house.10
I called upon the Lord in distress: the Lord answered me, and set me in a large place. The Lord is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me? The Lord taketh my part with them that help me. It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man.11

  ‘For he knoweth not that which shall be.’12 May our shortsightedness ask to know no more than the Omniscient wanted to make known to us, and may our dependence slowly yield to the Almighty. That is the lesson for the day.13
&nbsp;1r:4 
When I was a lad14

When I was a lad, my life carefree as ever,
I girt myself up, did whatever I chose,
Free to go wand’ring, to seek, to endeavour,
Free in my travels, my dreams, my repose.

Even for me, though, the hour was nearing
Of calling, of mercy, of seriousness,
When in my bosom the voice I’d been hearing
Enquired ‘Do you love me?’ – my soul answered ‘Yes’.

Since that hour of waking my dreams are no longer,
Another now leads me, at times ’gainst my will,
Teaches my hands to reach eagerly further,
To follow and carry, oh, happy and still.

Yet now that life’s governed by the Supreme Being,
Despite pain and fetters, my soul torn apart –
I find what in life I’d once vainly been seeking:
More rest and more peace for my uneasy heart.

And now a handshake to you both and to Mr and Mrs Roos and to Willem,15 and to anyone else you might see whom I know. And let me know soon how you are and believe me

Your most loving brother,
Vincent

Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?16 is a question that often springs to one’s lips, and often we must ask, Oh, bless that which I shall do. May that prayer of ours be heard: Father, I pray not that Thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that Thou shouldest keep them from the evil.17 So be it.


&nbsp;2r:5 
It happened that we found ourselves alone, my mother and I, at an open window, where we had a view of the garden of the house to which we had betaken ourselves at the harbour of Ostia. There, far from the crowd, we were awaiting the time of the crossing after the fatigue of a long journey. We were alone, conversing with inexpressible pleasure; and, forgetting the past and dwelling completely on the future, we talked about what that eternal life of the saints would be like, which no eye hath seen, nor ear heard, nor any heart conceived. And, transported on the wings of Love to Him who is, we wandered in spirit to those heavenly spheres, whence the stars, the moon and the sun send us their light. And rising ever higher in our thoughts, in our words, in the admiration of Thy works, O Lord, it was as though we left our bodies, in order to attain uncreated wisdom, which is what it was, what it ever will be, or rather, in which there is no ‘having been’ or ‘what must still be’ but only ‘being’, because it is eternal, because ‘having been’ and ‘what must still be’ exclude eternity. And as we were speaking thus, in the flight of our thoughts towards that life, we touched it for an instant in spirit, and we groaned and allowed to be caught the first-fruits of the spirit, and descended again to the sound of voices, to words that begin and end.
Thus we spoke: If there is a soul in which the voice of the flesh falls silent, which imposes silence on itself, and, forgetting itself, oversteps its innermost bounds; if the last voice is lost in silence, after our soul has raised itself to the origin of all things, and He alone speaks, not through His creatures but through himself, if He speaks to us, He alone whom we hold dear above all else; if He speaks to us while everything drains out of us and while all beholding of a lower order ss, holding the viewer in thrall, enraptured, in his quiet joy and carrying him away; if eternal life is ultimately the same as this brief bliss that makes us go on groaning; is that not the promise held by the words ‘Enter thou into the joy of Thy Lord’? Such were our thoughts as we spoke.
Augustine18

For where two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them.19

I just received Pa’s letter. Thank God. May God make us brothers.20

Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not Charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not Charity, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not Charity, it profiteth me nothing. Charity suffereth long, and is kind; Charity envieth not; Charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; rejoiceth not 
&nbsp;2v:6  in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things. For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known. And now abideth faith, hope, Charity; but the greatest of these is Charity.21

As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as chastened, but not killed.22

As one whom his mother comforteth.23

From here I see a lady, I see her walking, pensive, in a garden that is not very big and has lost its flowers quite early, but is sheltered, like the ones one sees behind our cliffs in France or the dunes of Holland. The exotic shrubs have already gone back into the greenhouse. The fallen leaves reveal some statues which one is all the more eager to look at now that the flowers have gone. A sumptuousness of art, which contrasts slightly with the very simple attire of the lady — modest, grave — the black or grey silk of which is barely brightened by a plain lilac ribbon. Unadorned, this we can say, she is no less elegant. Elegant for her husband and simple for the benefit of the poor. She reaches the end of the avenue, turns. We can see her. But have I not seen her before in the museums of Amsterdam or The Hague? She reminds me of a lady by Philippe de Champaigne, who had found her way into my heart, so ingenuous, so honest, sufficiently intelligent, yet simple, without the subtlety to extricate herself from the snares of this world. This woman has remained with me for thirty years, obstinately returning to me, worrying me, making me say, But what was she called? What became of her? Did she have a little happiness? And how did she manage to get through life? She reminds me of another portrait, a Van Dyck, a poor woman, very pale, unhealthy. The pale satin of the incomparably delicate skin clothes a sickly body, which is beginning to slacken. A great melancholy fills her lovely eyes, the melancholy of old age? Of heartbreaks, of the climate too, perhaps. It is the vague, distant look of someone who has lived within sight of the vast North Sea, the great grey sea, deserted but for the flight of the seagull.

Michelet, Les aspirations de l’automne.24

Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.25 The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil. She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life. She riseth while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens. Her candle goeth not out by night. She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy. She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet. Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come. She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness. She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness. Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her, saying: Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all. Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised. Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.26 Two things have I required of the Lord; deny me them not before I die: Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me.27 It is better to be in the house of mourning than in the house of feasting. Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.28 O Lord, join us intimately to one another and let our Love for Thee make that bond ever stronger,29 and let our latter days be closer to Thee and therefore better than these. When once life’s evening overcomes me, worn down by ills and strife always, for every day Thou hast allowed me, I’ll bring Thee higher, purer praise.30 Intreat me not to leave Thee, Lord, or to return from following after Thee. Thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.31top

My dear Theo,
I was so grateful for your short letter and for what Ma wrote,1 so we’ll wait until Christmas, and then may God let us see one another again in peace.
‘My illness is not a bad thing’.2 No, for Sorrow is better than laughter.3 No, being ill and supported by God’s arm,4 and acquiring new ideas and resolutions during the days of one’s illness, which couldn’t occur to us when we weren’t ill, and acquiring clearer faith and firmer trust during those days, that’s not a bad thing. We worship and are silent.5 Living in the world must become a matter of giving to the world that which is of the world, while Religion, striving to do God’s will, must become the main concern.
Religion – doing God’s will, being a Christian – what is that? Let us seek it, and may God spare our lives, and godly sorrow6 shall not be fruitless. Its work is wrought invisibly, yet powerfully.7
‘This shall be the covenant that I will make with them; After those days, saith the Lord, I will put My law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be My people.
And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know Me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more. Thus saith the Lord, which giveth the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The Lord of hosts is His name.’8 
&nbsp;1v:2 
Must living in the world become a matter of giving to the world that which is of the world? Yes, but that living in the world means being ‘chastened, but not killed’,9 oh, there may be beautiful, rich days in all phases of one’s life, if the love of Christ constrains us.10 How well Eliot11 can describe them. Life in the world is chastened but not killed, go back into it like a child. These are beautiful words: ‘be ye therefore harmless as doves and wise as serpents’.12
Behold, all things are become new.13
I heard the Rev. Bersier14 say that when he was faced with a period of suffering and difficulties in which one says: ‘All these things are against us’.15
‘All things are become new’,16 he said with emotion, as though he saw through everything. These are beautiful words: ‘Nothing pleaseth me but in Jesus Christ, and in Him all things please me’,17 ‘though even in mirth the heart be sad’.18
‘My illness is not a bad thing’, no, for man’s extremity is God’s opportunity.19 When we are weak, we are strong.20 Being ill sanctifies being well and teaches one to be well.
Father, we pray that Thou dost not take us out of the world, but that Thou shouldest keep us from the evil.21 Just get well soon, old chap, oh, how I long for Christmas.
Herewith Anna’s last letter, she’ll probably think of Welwyn often once she has left it, everything is so beautiful there. 
&nbsp;1v:3 
Yesterday I was in Mr Jones’s church to help get everything ready for this evening. A vicar from Leicester will be giving a lecture on the Reformation and illustrating it with a magic lantern showing scenes from that period. I’ve already seen some of the plates, they’re in the manner of Holbein.22 You know that many painters and draughtsmen here work in his manner. There was a very beautiful plate of Luther’s marriage.23 Last Monday there was a ‘tea-meeting’ at that church, it had been one year since the church was opened.24 There were at least 250 people at the reception, and afterwards Mr Jones and several other preachers spoke until late in the evening.
But again, old boy, who would be able to collect his thoughts at all if the feeling of duty did not join everything together? Who would be able to maintain some earnestness without childlike faith:25 we are travellers, strangers – forget those things which are behind, and reach forth unto those things which are before!26 It is also good to believe that an angel stands behind each one of us, it is good to feel in our hearts the cry, Abba, Father!27
It’s lovely here now, especially in the streets in the evening, when it’s a bit foggy and the street-lamps are lit, and also in that park I wrote to you about,28 I saw the sun setting there a couple of days ago, behind the elm trees whose leaves are now the colour of bronze. That haze which Anna writes about29 lay over the grass, and a brook runs through that park in which one sees the swans swimming. 
&nbsp;1r:4 
The acacias in the playground have already lost many of their leaves, one sees them through the window in front of my reading-desk, sometimes they stand out dark against the sky, sometimes one sees the sun behind them, rising up red in the mist.
It will surely be winter soon, how fortunate that Christmas is in the winter, that’s why I like winter better than any other season, Christmas and New Year’s Eve are even better than the autumn.
How wonderful it will be to sail down the Thames and across the sea, and then those friendly Dutch dunes and that small tower that one already sees from a great distance. How little we see of each other, old boy, and how little we see of our parents, and yet the feeling of our origins and of one another is so strong that the heart is at times uplifted and our eyes look to God, beseeching, Let me not stray too far from them, not for too long, O Lord!
Must man not struggle here on earth?30 You must have felt so when you were ill. No victory without a battle, no battle without suffering.

Many battles must be fought
Much of life with suffering fraught
Many prayers must needs be said
For a blissful end to lie ahead.31

Let me not stray too far from them, from Thy people, O Lord. Thou which art their God, be Thou also mine God, then we will be united in Thee, mould my heart after theirs, that a life may proceed from it as from theirs. And into Thy hands we commend our heart,32 though we endeavour to watch and pray and fight.33 Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the Lord keep the city, the watchmen waketh but in vain.34 Adieu, old boy, I wish you the very best, give my regards to those at the Rooses’ and to any other acquaintances you might see, and believe me, after a handshake in thought,

Your most loving brother
Vincent.

Shake Uncle Jan’s35 hand for me.

Isleworth

My dear Theo,
It’s again high time that you heard something from me. Thank God you’re recovering, I long so much for Christmas – perhaps that time will come before we know it, even though it seems a long way off.
Theo, your brother spoke for the first time in God’s house last Sunday,1 in the place where it is written ‘I will give peace in this place’.2 I’m copying out what it was herewith. May it be the first of many.
It was a clear autumn day and a lovely walk from here to Richmond along the Thames, which reflected the large chestnut trees with their load of yellow leaves and the clear blue sky, and between the tree-s the part of Richmond that lies on the hill, the houses with their red roofs and windows without curtains and green gardens, and the grey tower above it all, and below, the large grey bridge with tall poplars on either side, with people crossing it who looked like small black figures. When I stood in the pulpit I felt like someone emerging from a dark, underground vault into the friendly daylight, and it’s a wonderful thought that from now on, wherever I go, I’ll be preaching the gospel – to do that well one must have the gospel in his heart, may He bring this about. God says, Let there be light: and there is light.3 He speaks, and it is done. He commands, and it stands, and it stands fast.4 Faithful is He that calleth us, who also will do it.5 You know enough of the world, Theo, to see how a poor preacher stands rather alone as far as the world is concerned – but He can awaken in us, more and more, awareness and 
&nbsp;1v:2  firmness of faith. ‘And yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me’.6

I know in Whom my faith is founded,
Though day and night change constantly,
I know the rock on which I’m grounded,
My Saviour waits, unfailingly.
When once life’s evening overcomes me,
Worn down by ills and strife always,
For every day Thou hast allowed me,
I’ll bring Thee higher, purer praise.7

Praise, Christian, there on your left hand,
And on your right, is God –
When I have no more strength to stand,
When anguished, there is God –
When loving hand of faithful friend
Helps not, there is God –
In death and agony at life’s end,
Yes, everywhere is God.8

How I long for Christmas and to see all of you, old boy, it seems to me that I’ve grown years older in these few months.

The panting hart, the hunt escapèd,
Cries no harder for the pleasure
Of fresh flowing streams of water
Than my soul doth long for God.
Yea, my soul thirsts for the Lord,
God of life, oh when shall I
Approach Thy sight, and drawing nigh,
Give Thee praise in Thine own house.9

Why art thou cast down, my soul,
Disquieted in me, oh why?
Foster again the faith of old,
Rejoice in praising Him most high.
Oft hath he taken your distress
And turned it into happiness.
Hope in Him, eyes heavenward raised,
For to my God I still give praise.10

My boy, if illness and difficulties come to meet us, let us thank Him for bringing us into these hours – and let us not forget meekness, for it is written: On this man will I look, even on him who is poor and sorrowful and who trembleth at My word.11 Yesterday evening I went to Richmond again,12 and took a walk there on a large common surrounded by trees, and houses around it, above which the tower rose. Dew lay on the grass and it was growing dark; on one side the sky was still full of the glow of the sun that had just set there, on the other side the moon was rising. An old lady (dressed in black) with lovely grey hair was walking beneath the trees. In the middle of the common, some boys had lit a big fire, which one saw flickering in the distance; I thought of this: when once life’s evening overcomes me, worn down by ills and strife always, for every day Thou hast allowed me, I’ll bring Thee higher, purer praise.13 Adieu, a handshake in thought from

Your most loving brother,
Vincent

Regards to Mr and Mrs Tersteeg, Haanebeeks, Van Stockums and everyone at the Rooses’ and Van Iterson and if you should see someone or other whom I know.

Your brother was indeed moved when he stood at the foot of the pulpit and bowed his head and prayed ‘Abba, Father, let Thy name be our beginning’.

On Thursday week I hope to speak at Mr Jones’s church:14 And the Lord added daily to the church such as should be saved,15 on John and Theagenes.16 
&nbsp;2r:3 

Psalm 119:19 I am a stranger in the earth, hide not Thy commandments from me.

It is an old faith and it is a good faith that our life is a pilgrims progress – that we are strangers in the earth, but that though this be so, yet we are not alone for our Father is with us. We are pilgrims, our life is a long walk, a journey from earth to heaven.17
The beginning of this life is this. There is one who remembereth no more Her sorrow and Her anguish for joy that a man is born into the world. She is our Mother. The end of our pilgrimage is the entering in Our Fathers house where are many mansions, where He has gone before us to prepare a place for us.18 The end of this life is what we call death – it is an hour in which words are spoken, things are seen and felt that are kept in the secret chambers of the hearts of those who stand by, it is so that all of us have such things in our hearts or forebodings of such things. There is sorrow in the hour when a man is born into the world, but also joy19 – deep and unspeakable – thankfulness so great that it reacheth the highest Heavens. Yes the Angels of God, they smile, they hope and they rejoice when a man is born in the world. There is sorrow in the hour of death – but there too is joy unspeakable when it is the hour of death of one who has fought a good fight.20 There is One who has said, I am the resurrection and the life, if any man believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.21 There was an Apostle who heard a voice from heaven, saying: Blessed are they that die in the Lord for they rest from their labour and their works follow them.22 There is joy when a man is born in the world but there is greater joy when a Spirit has passed through great tribulation, when an Angel is born in Heaven. Sorrow is better than joy23 – and even in mirth the heart is sad24 – and it is better to go to the house of mourning than to the house of feasts,25 for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.26 Our nature is sorrowful but for those who have learnt and are learning to look at Jesus Christ there is always reason to rejoice. It is a good word, that of St Paul: As being sorrowful yet always rejoicing.27 For those who believe in Jesus Christ there is no death and no sorrow that is not mixed with hope – no despair – there is only a constantly being born again,28 a constantly going from darkness into light.29 They do not mourn as those who have no hope – Christian Faith makes life to evergreen life.

We are pilgrims in the earth and strangers30 – we come from afar and we are going far. The journey of our life goes from the loving breast of our Mother on earth to the arms of our Father in heaven. Everything on earth changes – we have no abiding city here31 – it is the experience of everybody: That it is Gods will that we should part with what we dearest have on earth – we ourselves, we change in many respects, we are not what we once were, we shall not remain what we are now. From infancy we grow up to boys and girls – young men and young women – and if God spares us and helps us – to husbands and wives, Fathers and Mothers in our turn, and then, slowly but surely the face that once had the ‘early dew of morning’32 gets its wrinkles, the eyes that once beamed with youth and gladness speak of a sincere deep and earnest sadness – though they may keep the fire of Faith, Hope and Charity33 – though they may beam with Gods spirit. The hair turns grey or we loosea it – ah – indeed we only pass through the earth, we only pass through life – we are strangers and pilgrims in the earth.34 The world passes and all its glory.35 Let our later days be nearer to Thee and therefore better than these. 
&nbsp;2v:4 
Yet we may not live on just anyhow – no, we have a strife to strive and a fight to fight.36 What is it we must do: We must love God with all our strength, with all our might, with all our heart, with all our soul, we must love our neighbour as ourselves.37 These two commandments we must keep and if we follow after these, if we are devoted to this, we are not alone for our Father in Heaven is with us, helps us and guides us, gives us strength day by day, hour by hour. and so we can do all things through Christ who gives us might.38 We are strangers in the earth, hide not Thy commandments from us. Open Thou our eyes, that we may behold wondrous things out of Thy law.39 Teach us to do Thy will40 and influence our hearts that the love of Christ may constrain us41 and that we may be brought to do what we must do to be saved.

On the road from earth to Heaven
Do Thou guide us with Thine eye.42

We are weak but Thou art mighty
Hold us with Thy powerful hand.43

Our life, we might compare it to a journey, we go from the place where we were born to a far off haven. Our earlier life might be compared to sailing on a river, but very soon the waves become higher, the wind more violent, we are at sea almost before we are aware of it – and the prayer from the heart ariseth to God: Protect me o God, for my bark is so small and Thy sea is so great.44 The heart of man is very much like the sea, it has its storms, it has its tides and in its depths it has its pearls too. The heart that seeks for God and for a Godly life has more storms than any other. Let us see how the Psalmist describes a storm at sea, He must have felt the storm in his heart to describe it so. We read in the 107th Psalm, They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters, these see the works of the Lord and His wonders in the deep. For He commandeth and raiseth up a stormy wind which lifteth up the waves thereof. They mount up to Heaven, they go down again to the depth, their soul melteth in them because of their trouble. Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble and He bringeth them out of their distresses, He bringeth them unto their desired haven.45
Do we not feel this sometimes on the sea of our lives. Does not everyone of you feel with me the storms of life or their forebodings or their recollections?
And now let us read a description of another storm at sea in the New Testament, as we find it in the VIth Chapter of the Gospel according to St John in the 17th to the 21st verse. And the disciples entered into a ship and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew. So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea and drawing nigh unto the ship and they were afraid. Then they willingly received Him into the ship and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.46 You who have experienced the great storms of life, you over whom all the waves and all the billows of the Lord have gone – have you not heard, when your heart failed for fear, the beloved well known voice – with something in its tone that reminded you of the voices that charmed your childhood – the voice of Him whose name is Saviour and Prince of peace,47 saying as it were to you personally – mind to you personally ‘It is I, be not afraid’.48 Fear not.49 Let not your heart be troubled.50 And we whose lives have been calm up to now, calm in comparison of what others have felt – let us not fear the storms of life, amidst the high waves of the sea and under the grey clouds of the sky we shall see Him approaching for Whom we have so often longed and watched, Him we need so – and we shall 
&nbsp;2v:5  hear His voice, It is I, be not afraid. And if after an hour or season of anguish or distress51 or great difficulty or pain or sorrow we hear Him ask us ‘Dost Thou love me’ then let us say, Lord Thou knowest all things, Thou knowest that I love Thee.52 And let us keep that heart full of the love of Christ and may from thence issue a life which the love of Christ constraineth.53 Lord Thou knowest all things, Thou knowest that I love Thee, when we look back on our past we feel sometimes as if we did love Thee, for whatsoever we have loved, we loved in Thy name. Have we not often felt as a widow and an orphan – in joy and prosperity as well, and more even than under grief – because of the thought of Thee.
Truly our soul waiteth for Thee more than they that watch for the morning54 – our eyes are up unto Thee, o Thou who dwellest in Heavens.55 In our days too there can be such a thing as seeking the Lord.

What is it we ask of God – is it a great thing? Yes it is a great thing, peace for the ground of our heart, rest for our soul – give us that one thing and then we want not much more, then we can do without many things, then can we suffer great things for Thy names sake.56 We want to know that we are Thine and that Thou art ours, we want to be thine – to be Christians. We want a Father, a Fathers love and a Fathers approval. May the experience of life make our eye single57 and fix it on Thee. May we grow better as we go on in life.

We have spoken of the storms on the journey of life, but now let us speak of the calms and joys of Christian life. And yet, my dear friends, let us rather cling to the seasons of difficulty and work and sorrow, even for the calms are treacherous often.
The heart has its storms, has its seasons of drooping58 but also its calms and even its times of exaltation. There is a time of sighing and of praying but there is also a time of answer to prayer. Weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning.59

The heart that is fainting
May grow full to o’erflowing
And they that behold it
Shall wonder and know not
That God at its fountains
Far off has been raining.60

My peace I leave with you61 – we saw how there is peace even in the storm. Thanks be to God who has given us to be born and to live in a Christian country. Has any of us forgotten the golden hours of our early days at home, and since we left that home – for many of us have had to leave that home and to earn their living and to make their way in the world. Has He not brought us thus far, have we lacked anything.62 We believe Lord, help Thou our unbelief.63 I still feel the rapture, the thrill of joy I felt when for the first time I cast a deep look in the lives of my Parents, when I felt by instinct how much they were Christians. And I still feel that feeling of eternal youth and enthusiasm wherewith I went to God, saying ‘I will be a Christian too’. 
&nbsp;2r:6 
  Are we what we dreamt we should be? No – but still – the sorrows of life, the multitude of things of daily life and of daily duties, so much more numerous than we expected – the tossing to and fro in the world, they have covered it over – but it is not dead, it sleepeth.64 The old eternal faith and love of Christ, it may sleep in us but it is not dead and God can revive it in us. But though to be born again to eternal life,65 to the life of Faith, Hope and Charity66 – and to an evergreen life – to the life of a Christian and of a Christian workman67 be a gift of God, a work of God – and of God alone – yet let us put the hand to the plough68 on the field of our heart, let us cast out our net once more69 – let us try once more – God knows the intention of the spirit, God knows us better than we know ourselves for He made us and not we ourselves.70 He knows of what things we have need,71 He knows what is good for us. May He give His blessing on the seed of His word72 that has been sown in our hearts.
God helping us, we shall get through life. With every temptation He will give a way to escape.73
Father we pray Thee not that Thou shouldest take us out of the world, but we pray Thee to keep us from evil.74 Give us neither poverty nor riches, feed us with bread convenient for us.75 And let Thy songs be our delight in the houses of our pilgrimage. God of our Fathers be our God: may their people be our people, their Faith our faith.76 We are strangers in the earth, hide not Thy commandments from us but may the love of Christ constrain us.77 Entreat us not to leave Thee or to refrain from following after Thee. Thy people shall be our people, Thou shalt be our God.78

Our life is a pilgrims progress. I once saw a very beautiful picture,79 it was a landscape at evening. In the distance on the right hand side a row of hills appearing blue in the evening mist. Above those hills the splendour of the sunset, the grey clouds with their linings of silver and gold and purple. The landscape is a plain or heath covered with grass and heather, here and there the white stem of a birch tree and its yellow leaves, for it was in Autumn. Through the landscape a road leads to a high mountain far far away, on the top of that mountain a city whereon the setting sun casts a glory. On the road walks a pilgrim, staff in hand. He has been walking for a good long while already and he is very tired. And now he meets a woman, a figure in black that makes one think of St Pauls word ‘As being sorrowful yet always rejoicing’.80 That Angel of God has been placed there to encourage the pilgrims and to answer their questions:


&nbsp;3r:7 

  
    And the pilgrim asks her: 
    &nbsp;
    Does the road go uphill then all the way?
  
  
    and the answer is
    &nbsp;
     “Yes to the very end”─
  
  
    and he asks again:
    &nbsp;
    And will the journey take all day long?
  
  
    and the answer is:
    &nbsp;
    “From morn till night my friend”.81
  





    
    And the pilgrim goes on sorrowful yet always rejoicing82 – sorrowful because it is so far off and the road so long. Hopeful as he looks up to the eternal city far away, resplendent in the evening glow, and he thinks of two old sayings he has heard long ago – the one is:

‘There must much strife be striven
There must much suffering be suffered
There must much prayer be prayed
And then the end will be peace.’83

and the other:

The water comes up to the lips
But higher comes it not.84

And he says, I shall be more and more tired but also nearer and nearer to Thee.85 Has not man a strife on earth? But there is a consolation from God in this life. An angel of God, comforting men – that is the Angel of Charity. Let us not forget Her. And when everyone of us goes back to daily things and daily duties, let us not forget – that things are not what they seem, that God by the things of daily life teacheth us higher things, that our life is a pilgrims progress and that we are strangers in the earth – but that we have a God and Father who preserveth strangers,86 and that we are all bretheren.87
Amen.

And now the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, our Father, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us for evermore.
Amen.88

(Reading Scripture Psalm XCI)


&nbsp;3v:8 
Tossed with rough winds and faint with fear,
Above the tempest soft and clear
What still small accents greet mine ear
‘’t Is I, be not afraid.’

’t Is I, who washed thy spirit white;
’t Is I, who gave thy blind eyes sight,
’t Is I, thy Lord, thy life, thy light,
’t Is I, be not afraid.

These raging winds, this surging sea
Have spent their deadly force on me
They bear no breath of wrath to Thee
’t Is I, be not afraid.

This bitter cup, I drank it first
To thee it is no draught accurst
The hand that gives it thee is pierced
‘’t Is I, be not afraid’.

When on the other side thy feet,
Shall rest, mid thousand welcomes sweet;
One well known voice thy heart shall greet –
’t Is I, be not afraid.

Mine eyes are watching by thy bed
Mine arms are underneath thy head
My blessing is around Thee shed
‘’t Is I, be not afraid’.89

Again, a handshake in thought – yesterday evening I was at Turnham Green in place of Mr Jones, who wasn’t well. I walked over there with the oldest boy, 17 years old, but he’s as big as I am and has a beard. He’ll go into business later, his father has a large factory; he has a good, honest, feeling heart and a great need of religion, it is his hope and desire to do good among the workers later on in life, I recommended ‘Felix Holt’ by Eliot90 to him. It was lovely in the park91 with the old elm trees in the moonlight and the dew on the grass. It was so good for me to speak in the little church, it is a little wooden church.92 Goodbye, Theo. Goodbye, old boy, I hope I’ve written it so that you’ll be able to read it. Remain steadfast and do get well soon.top

Isleworth, 10 November 1876.

My dear Theo,
I feel the need to enclose a few words to you. You’ll be having pleasant days at home,1 I almost envy you, old boy.
What lovely autumn weather we’re having. You probably see the sun rising in the morning too. Which room are you sleeping in?
If you can get ‘The imitation of Christ’ one of these days,2 read some of it, it’s a wonderful book, one that’s very enlightening. It describes so beautifully, for the one who wrote the book did it himself, how good it is to wage the holy war of devotion to one’s duty, and the heartfelt joy that is to be found in doing good deeds and in doing what one does well.
You must read the letter for Pa and Ma sometime, I’ve taken such lovely walks recently, which were especially good after the anxiety of the first months here.
It is indeed true that every day has its own evil3 and its own good, too. But how terrible life must 
&nbsp;1v:2  be, especially later on – when the evil of each day increases as far as the things of the world are concerned – if it isn’t supported and comforted by faith. And in Christ all things of the world can improve and become sanctified, as it were. These are beautiful words, and happy are those who come across them, ‘Nothing pleaseth me but in Christ, and in Him all things please me’.4 But one doesn’t achieve this all of a sudden. But he that seeketh findeth.5
Do write a few words again the next time Pa and Ma write. I hope to go to Richmond again on Monday evening and to take the words: But when he was yet a great way off, his Father saw him, and had compassion.6
Theo, woe is me if I don’t preach the gospel,7 and if I didn’t have my sight fixed on that and 
&nbsp;1v:3  didn’t have hope and faith in Christ, then I would only have woe. Now, however, I have a bit of spirit as well.
I should have liked you to be in the little church at Turnham Green last Thursday evening; I walked over there with the oldest boy in the school and told him several of Andersen’s fairy tales, including ‘The story of a mother’.8
And now we’re slowly heading towards winter, and many dread it, but Christmas is wonderful, it’s like the moss on the roofs and like the pine and the holly and the ivy in the snow. How I’d like to come with Anna, may she find something soon,9 I’ll write to her again today.
Today one of the maids left, they don’t have it easy here and she couldn’t stand it any longer – indeed, 
&nbsp;1r:4  everyone, richer or poorer, stronger or weaker, has moments when he can go no further, when ‘all these things seem to be against us’,10 when much of what we have built collapses.
And yet, one mustn’t lose heart, Elijah had to pray all of seven times,11 and David had ashes on his head many a time.12
There’s a new assistant teacher at the school, because I’ll have to work more at Turnham Green from now on. He has never been away from home before, and won’t find it easy in the beginning.
And now a handshake in thought, it’s already late and I’m rather tired. I wish you well. Do think now and then of

Your most loving and affectionate brother
Vincent

Isleworth, 17 November 1876

Dear Father and Mother,
  Thank God Theo continues to get better, and bully for him, already walking in the snow to Het Heike1 with Pa, how I’d have liked to walk along with you both. It’s already late, and early tomorrow morning I have to go to London and Lewisham for Mr Jones, where I hope to drop by and see Gladwell. It will be late at night before I’m home again.
Where do Mr Jones and the others get their income from? Yes, I’ve thought about that many times. Here one often hears it said that God takes care of those who work for Him. I dearly long to talk to you about this and to confer. You then ask, too, whether I still give lessons to the boys: I do so every day until 1 o’clock, and then after 1 o’clock I usually have to go out for Mr Jones, or sometimes also teach Mr Jones’s children or a couple of boys in town. And then in the evening and in my spare moments I write in my sermon book.
Last Sunday I arrived at Turnham Green early to teach at Sunday school; it was a real, English, rainy day. In the morning Mr Jones delivered a sermon on the woman of Samaria,2 and afterwards there was Sunday school. I also have to do this during the week; there are quite a few children, but it’s a job to round them all up regularly. In the afternoon Mr Jones and his son3 and I went 
&nbsp;1v:2  and had tea with the sexton,4 a shoemaker who lives in one of the suburbs. There was a view from the window there that reminded me very much of Holland – a flat, grass-covered area, which the torrential rains had turned almost into a morass, surrounded by rows of little red houses with their gardens and the lights of the street-lamps that were being lit. In the evening Mr Jones delivered a sermon on Naaman the Syrian,5 very beautiful, and afterwards the walk home. Last Thursday Mr Jones let me take his turn, and I took as my text ‘I would to God, that not only thou, but all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds’.6
Next Sunday evening I have to go to Petersham to a Methodist church;7 Petersham is a village on the Thames, about 20 minutes beyond Richmond; I don’t know yet what I’ll talk about, the prodigal son8 or Ps. 42:1.9
Mornings and evenings Sunday school at Turnham Green.
And so the weeks pass and we approach winter, and the congenial Christmas festivities. Tomorrow I have to be in two remote parts of London, in Whitechapel – that extremely poor area which you’ll have read about in Dickens10 – and then cross the Thames in a boat 
&nbsp;1v:3  and from there to Lewisham.
Mr Jones’s children are better again, but now 3 of the boys have the measles.
This week I had to go on a journey for Mr Jones with one of the boys to Acton Green, which is that grassy area that the sexton’s window looks out on.
It was surprisingly muddy there, but it was a beautiful sight when it began to grow dark and the mist rose and one saw the light of a small church in the middle of the green.11 And to our left were railway tracks on a rather high embankment, and at that moment a train came, and that was a beautiful sight, the red glow of the locomotive and the rows of lights inside the carriages in the twilight. To our right a few horses were grazing in a meadow surrounded by a hedge of hawthorn and blackberry bushes.
As I sit writing to you in my room and it’s so very, very quiet and I look around at your portraits and the prints on the wall, Christus Consolator12 and Good Friday13 and the Women at the sepulchre14 and The old Huguenot15 and The prodigal son by Ary Scheffer16 and the little boat on a stormy sea17 and one etching, 
&nbsp;1r:4  an autumn landscape, view of the heath, which I got from Harry Gladwell on my birthday,18 and when I think of all of you and then of all those here and of Turnham Green and Richmond and Petersham &amp;c., then I feel ‘Stay, Lord, and hear the prayer my Mother said for me when I left my parent’s house: Father, I pray not that Thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that Thou shouldest keep them from the evil,19 and, Lord, oh if Thou would only make me, not only almost but altogether, as it were, my Father’s brother,20 a Christian and a Christian worker. Complete Thy work in me which Thou hast begun.21 Yea, make me, slowly but surely, step by step, and almost and altogether, my Father’s brother.
And O Lord, join us intimately to one another and let our love for Thee make that bond ever stronger.’22
And now good-night to you both and to Theo23 and Willemien and Cor, I’m longing again for a letter from you. Good-night, I have to get up early tomorrow, a handshake in thought from

Your most loving and affectionate
Vincent

From the other end of L.24 I bid you all good-day! I left this morning at 4 o’clock, now it’s 2. I just came through the old cabbage fields, now on to Lewisham. A man sometimes says, how shall I manage it? Adieu.

Isleworth, 25 Nov. 1876

My dear Theo,
Thanks for your last letter, which I received at the same time as one from Etten. So you’re back at the gallery. Do whatever your hand finds to do, with all your might,1 and your work and prayers cannot fail to be blessed. How I’d have liked to go along on that walk to Het Heike and to Sprundel2 in the first snow. But before I go further, I’ll copy out a couple of poems that you’ll no doubt like.

The journey of life3

Two lovers by a mossgrown spring
They leaned soft cheeks together
Mingled the dark and sunny hair,
And heard the wooing thrushes sing
o Budding time
o Loves best prime.

Two wedded from the portal steps
The bells made happy carolings
The air was soft as fanning wings
While petals on the pathway slept
O pure eyed bride
o tender pride.

Two faces o’er a cradle bent
Two hands above the head were locked
These pressed each other while they rocked
Those watched a life which love had sent
O solemn hour
o hidden power.

Two parents by the evening fire
The red light fell about their knees
On heads that rose by slow degrees
Like buds upon the lily spire
O patient life
O tender strife.

The two still sat together there
The red light shone about their knees
But all the heads by slow degrees
Had gone and left that lonely pair
O Voyage fast
O Banished past.

The red light shone upon the floor
And made the space between them wide
They drew their chairs up side by side
Their pale cheeks joined, and said ‘once more’
O, memories!
O past that is!

The three little chairs.4

They sat alone by the bright woodfire
The grey-haired dame and the aged sire
Dreaming of days gone by;
The tear drop fell on the wrinkled cheek
They both had thoughts that they could not speak,
And each heart uttered a sigh.

For their sad and tearful eyes descried
Three little chairs placed side by side
Against the sitting room wall;
Old fashioned enough as there they stood
Their seats of flag, and their frames of wood,
With their backs so straight and tall.

Then the sire shook His silvery head,
And with trembling voice he gently said,
‘Mother, those empty chairs,
They bring us such sad, sad thoughts tonight,
We’ll put them for ever out of sight
In the small dark room upstairs’.

But she answered: Father, no, not yet;
For I look at them, and I forget
That the children went away,
The boys come back, and our Mary, too,
With her apron on of checkered blue
And sit here every day.

Johnny still whittles a ships tall masts,
And Willie his leaden bullets casts
While Mary her patchwork sows;
At evening time three childish prayers
Go up to God from those little chairs,
So softly that no one knows.

Johnny comes back from the billowy deep,
Willie wakes from the battle field sleep,
To say good night to me:
Mary’s a wife and mother no more,
But a tired child whose play-time is o’er,
  And comes to rest on my knee.
&nbsp;1v:2 
So let them stand there – though empty now,
And every time when alone we bow
At the Fathers throne to pray,
We’ll ask to meet the children above
In our Saviours home of rest and love,
Where no child goeth away.

In his letter Pa wrote, among other things: ‘in the afternoon I had to go to Hoeven, Ma had ordered the cab but it couldn’t come, because they hadn’t yet been able to have the horses’ shoes frosted – I therefore decided to go on foot and good Uncle Jan5 didn’t want me to go alone, so he came along. It was a hard journey, but Uncle Jan rightly said: the devil is never so black that you can’t look him in the face.6 And indeed, we arrived there and returned safe and sound, even though there was a gale blowing, coupled with freezing rain, so that the roads were slippery as ice, and I cannot describe how wonderful it was to sit so cosily in a nice warm room in the evening, resting after work – that dear Theo was still with us then’.
Shall we, too, go once again to some church in this way? As sorrowful yet alway rejoicing,7 with everlasting joy in our hearts because we are the poor in the kingdom of God,8 because we have found in Christ a friend in our lives that sticketh closer than a brother,9 who brought us to the end of the journey as to the door of the Father’s house. May God grant it – what God hath done is done aright.10
Last Sunday evening I went to a village on the Thames, Petersham. In the morning I had been at the Sunday school at Turnham Green, and went after sunset from there to Richmond and then on to Petersham. It grew dark early and I wasn’t sure of the way, it was a surprisingly muddy road over a kind of embankment or rise on the hill covered with gnarled elm trees and shrubs. At last I saw below the rise a light in a small house, and scrambled and waded over to it, and there I was told the way. But, old boy, 
&nbsp;1v:3  there was a beautiful little wooden church with a kindly light11 at the end of that dark road, I read Acts V:14-16.12 Acts XII:5-17, Peter in prison, and Acts XX:7-37, Paul preaching in Macedonia, and then I told the story of John and Theagenes yet again.13 There was a harmonium in the church, played by a young woman from a boarding school that was attending en masse.
In the morning it was so beautiful on the way to Turnham Green, the chestnut trees and clear blue sky and the morning sun were reflected in the water of the Thames, the grass was gloriously green and everywhere all around the sound of church bells. The day before I’d gone on a long journey to London, I left here at 4 in the morning, arrived at Hyde Park at half past six, the mist was lying on the grass and leaves were falling from the trees, in the distance one saw the shimmering lights of street-lamps that hadn’t yet been put out, and the towers of Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament, and the sun rose red in the morning mist – from there on to Whitechapel, that poor district of London, then to Chancery Lane and Westminster, then to Clapham to visit Mrs Loyer again, her birthday was the day before.14 She is indeed a widow in whose heart the psalms of David and the chapters of Isaiah are not dead but sleeping.15 Her name is written in the book of life.16 I also went to Mr Obach’s to see his wife and children again.17 Then from there to Lewisham, where I arrived at the Gladwells at half past three. It was exactly 3 months ago that I was there that Saturday their daughter was buried,18 I stayed with them around 3 hours and thoughts of many kinds occurred to all of us, too many to express. There I also wrote to Harry in Paris. I hope you’ll see him sometime. 
&nbsp;1r:4 
It may well be that you too will go to Paris sometime. That night I was back here at half past ten, I went part of the way with the underground railway. Fortunately I’d received some money for Mr Jones. Am working on Ps. 42:1, My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God.19 At Petersham I told the congregation that they would be hearing poor English, but that when I spoke I thought of the man in the parable who said ‘have patience with me, and I will pay thee all’,20 God help me.
At Mr Obach’s I saw the painting, or rather the sketch, by Boughton: the pilgrim’s progress.21 If you can ever get Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s progress, it’s very worthwhile reading. For my part I love it with heart and soul.22
It’s night-time now, I’m still doing a bit of work for the Gladwells at Lewisham, copying out one thing and another etc.; one must strike while the iron is hot and soften the human heart when it is burning within us.23 Tomorrow off to London again for Mr Jones. Beneath that poem The journey of life and The three little chairs one should write: that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth.24 So be it. A handshake in thought, give my regards to Mr and Mrs Tersteeg and to everyone at the Rooses’ and the Haanebeeks’ and the Van Stockums’ and the Mauves’, adieu and believe me

Your most loving brother

Etten, 31 December 18761

My dear Theo,
I sincerely wish you the best in the new year, I wish you well and may you be blessed in all things. Wonderful to have seen each other again, how beautiful it was that morning you left, and how often we’ll think back on that trip to Chaam.2
Ma’s eye is hurting a lot again, she has a bandage on; Pa delivered such a beautiful sermon again this morning.
And now this evening New Year’s Eve again, if only you were here.
Now then, there’s something I must tell you: a couple of days ago Mr Braat of Dordrecht3 paid a visit to Uncle Vincent and they spoke about me, and Uncle asked Mr B. whether he would have a place for me, if I should wish it. Mr B. thought he might have a place, and said that I should come sometime to talk about it. So I went there early yesterday morning; Pa and Ma and I, too, thought it was something we shouldn’t let pass without seeing what it was.
Agreed that after the New Year I should go to him for a week, after that we’ll see.4
There are many things that make it desirable, first and foremost my being back in Holland near Pa and Ma, and also you and the others.5 Moreover, the salary would certainly be a little better than with Mr Jones, and especially with an eye to later, when a man has need of more, 
&nbsp;1v:2  one is obliged to think of such things.
As far as the other thing is concerned, for these reasons I won’t give it up. Pa’s spirit is so great and many-sided, and at all events I hope that something of it will develop in me. The change means that now, instead of teaching those boys, I’ll be working in a bookshop.
How often we’ve longed to be together, and how terrible it is to feel so far away from one another in cases of illness or anxiety, as we felt, for example, during your illness, and then the feeling that lack of money may very well stand in the way of our being together in times of need.
It’s quite possible, then, that I’ll go there.
Yesterday evening I was at Uncle Vincent’s to tell him that I’d just been to Dordrecht, it was a stormy evening, you can imagine how beautiful the road to Princenhage was with the dark clouds with their silver linings. I also went briefly to the Roman Catholic church, where evening Mass was under way, it was a beautiful sight, all those peasants and their wives with their black clothes and white caps, and the church looked so friendly in the evening light. You must also tell Mr Tersteeg straightaway that I’ll be going there for a week to see how it goes, let His Hon. read this letter, if you will, and be sure to give him and his wife my best wishes for a happy New Year. I’m writing in great haste, Anna and the girls6 and Cor went to Princenhage, and Pa wanted me to go with them. Aunt7 came back with them in the carriage and I went for a walk with Willem Carbentus.8 Now, old boy, dear brother, what good days those were when we were all together,9 have a good New Year’s Eve and believe me

Your loving brother
Vincent

More soon – adieu. If you write, send your letter to Dordrecht.10

Dordrecht, 21 January 1877

My dear Theo,
You’ll have expected a letter sooner; things are going rather well in the shop,1 and it’s so busy that I go there at 8 o’clock in the morning and come back at 1 o’clock at night, but I’m happy about that.
I hope to go to Etten on 11 February. As you know, that’s when they’ll celebrate Pa’s birthday,2 would you be able to come as well? I hope to give Pa Eliot’s ‘Novellen’ (a translation of Scenes from clerical life),3 if we were to give something together we could give him Adam Bede4 as well.
Wrote last Sunday to Mr Jones and his wife that I’m not coming back, and without my being able to help it, the letter grew quite long – out of the abundance of the heart5 – did wish that they, for their part, would remember me, and asked them ‘to wrap my recollection in the cloak of Charity’.6
The two prints of Christus Consolator that I got from you are hanging in my little room7 – saw the paintings in the museum,8 and also ‘Christ in Gethsemane’ by Scheffer,9 which is unforgettable, a long time ago that painting moved Pa just as much – then there’s a sketch of The sorrows of the earth10 and various drawings,11 and also the portrait of his studio12 and, as you know, the portrait of his Mother.13 There are other beautiful paintings as well, such as the Achenbach14 and Schelfhout15 and Koekkoek16 and, among others, a beautiful Allebé, an old man by the stove.17 
&nbsp;1v:2 
Will we look at them together some day?
The first Sunday I was here I heard a sermon on ‘Behold, I make all things new’,18 and in the evening ‘Now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things’.19
This morning I went to hear the Rev. Beversen in a small old church,20 it was the Lord’s Supper and his text was ‘If any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink’.21
The window of my room looks out over gardens with pine trees and poplars etc. and the back of old houses, including a large one covered with ivy,22 ‘a strange old plant is the ivy green’, said Dickens.23 There can be something so serious and rather sombre in that view, and you should see it with the morning sun on it.
When I look at it I sometimes think of a letter of yours in which you speak of such an ivy-covered house, do you remember it? 
&nbsp;1v:3 
If you can afford it – if I can, I’ll do it too – subscribe to this year’s Katholieke Illustratie24, which has Doré’s prints of London – the wharves on the Thames, Westminster, Whitechapel, the Underground railway &amp;c. &amp;c.25
One of the people in the house I live in is a schoolmaster.26 Last Sunday, and today as well, we took a lovely walk along the canals and outside town as well, along the river Merwede,27 we also passed the place where you waited for the boat.
This evening when the sun went down and was reflected in the water and the windows, throwing a strong golden glow on everything, it was just like a painting by Cuyp.28 This evening I went to hear the Rev. Keller van Hoorn,29 who spoke on ‘I come to do Thy will, O Lord’.30 He just lost his daughter,31 and in all his words – I also heard him speak on ‘He that hath not loved knoweth not God; for God is love’32 – one can sense what he feels.
Write again soon when you have the time, I’ll have rather a lot of bookkeeping to do for the time being and will no doubt be busy. Give my regards to everyone at the Rooses’, and accept a handshake in thought from

Your loving brother
Vincent
