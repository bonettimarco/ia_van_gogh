[sketch A]

This little church is a remarkable remnant of an old Augustinian foundation (Austin Friars) dating from at least 1354, if not from 100 years earlier. The Dutch congregation had held its religious services here since 1550, by virtue of a voluntary gift of Edward VI.

A winter evening

At sunset all the forest seems as though
In contemplation; clumps of russet oaks,
Small junipers, sparse holly bushes, And not a leaf doth tremble in the light.

The only sound, a bird, belated toiler
In the distant stand of ancient chestnut trees;
Across the mighty, peaceful woods we hear
The yaffle, with his bill’s staccato hammering. 

Strange bird, familiar to this man who passes by
In sunset’s pure, calm glimmering.
’Tis not an old man, feet dragging as he goes,
His back bent low, drawn on weary legs.

’Tis is a rude fellow from the forest comes,
Laden with dead wood. His stride is long and firm,
He’s seen the sun, like a great orange in the sky,
That yonder sinks into the grass and disappears. 

Cheerfully he goes; pondering in his inmost heart Some source of happiness – into the clear, cold sky
Rises a plume of smoke, a long, straight plume. His old mask, rugged and weather-worn, lights up.

Night may have fallen by the time he gains
That fold of ground where the horizon ends,
But on his back he has a goodly beech-wood fire,
To brighten every corner of the house.

There, beneath a mossy roof, door and window closed
At bedtime, his children with delight
Will open wide their eyes, dazzled by the flames,
When off their small pink feet he takes the shoes.

Afternoon in February

The day is ending
The night descending
The marsh is frozen
The river dead.

Through clouds like ashes
The red sun flashes
On village windows
That glimmer red.

And through the meadows
Like fearful shadows
Slowly passes
a funeral train.

    Three kingsdaughters fair
Fly away my heart away
Sweet appleblossoms bloom
So sweet so sweet.

Ah says the eldest one
Fly away my heart away.
The days began so sweet
So sweet.

Ah says the second one
Fly away my heart away
Far off I hear the drum
So sweet.

Ah says the youngest one
Fly away my heart away
’t Is my true love my own
So sweet.2

To Mr Jules Breton
  at Courrières1

It was about 25 years ago that a man from Granville left for England.
 After his father’s death, his brothers fell out over the inheritance, and attempted above all to deprive him, in particular, of his share. Tired of quarrelling, he gave up his share to them and left as a poor man for London, where he obtained a post as a French teacher in a school.
 He was 30 when he married an Englishwoman, a good deal younger than himself; he had 1 child, a daughter. After he had been married for 7 or 8 years, his chest complaint became worse.
 One of his friends then asked him if he still had any wish, to which he replied that before he died he would like to see his own country again.
 His friend paid his travelling expenses.
 And so he left for Granville, deathly ill, with his wife and his 6-year-old daughter.
&nbsp;1v:2  There he rented a room from some poor people living near the sea.
 In the evening he would have himself carried to the shore and would watch the sun setting in the sea.
 One evening, seeing that he was close to death, the people advised his wife that it was time to send for the priest, so that he could give the sick man the last rites.
 His wife, who was Protestant, objected, but he said, ‘let them’.
 And so the priest arrived and the sick man made his confession before all the household.
 Then all those present wept, hearing of this just and pure life.
 Afterwards, he wished to be left alone with his wife, and when they were alone he kissed her and said, ‘I have loved you’.
 And then he died.
&nbsp;1v:3  
 He loved France, Brittany especially, and nature, and he saw God in it; for that reason you should mourn him as a brother.
 In many respects he was your brother, that is why I am telling you about the life of this ‘stranger on the earth’2 who nevertheless was one of its true citizens.
 Farewell, Sir, think of him sometimes.

I wrote the same letter to Alphonse Karr in Nice, only instead of what follows I put:3 ‘I believed I ought to tell you this, you, my friend the author of Voyage autour de mon jardin and of Clovis Gosselin,4 you who loved the poor lady who was with you on the boat from Lyon, you who love Normandy’s cottages, surrounded by apple trees in blossom’.5

To Emile Souvestre.
   ‘And you, too, love Brittany and the last Bretons’.6 That is why I am telling you about the life of this stranger on the earth who nevertheless was one of its true citizens. 
 
&nbsp;1r:4 
 I loved that unusual and slightly sad town (Granville), which lives on deep-sea fishing of the most dangerous kind. The family knows that it is fed from the hazards of that lottery, of man’s life and death.
 That adds overall a serious note to the wild character of that coast.
 I have many times savoured the melancholy of evening, either when walking down to the already darkened beach, or when from the  of the town that crowns the rock, I could see the sun going down on the slightly misty horizon.
 Its huge globe, often strongly marked by black and red stripes, would sink, without stopping to create fantasies in the sky, landscapes in light, which often enliven the view elsewhere.
 In August, it was already autumn. There was scarcely any dusk. No sooner had the sun set than the wind would grow chill, the waves would run fast, green and dark. There was little to be seen but a few shadowy women in their black capes, lined with white. The sheep straggling on the poor pastures of the slopes that overhang the beach from 80 or 100 feet would make it sad with their plaintive bleating.

Michelet, La mer7

And Naomi’s husband died, and she remained.
 And Ruth said: Intreat me not to leave thee, in order to take myself from thee, for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest I will lodge. Thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God. Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried. May the Lord grant that nothing but death part thee from me.
 So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is not Naomi here? And she replied unto them: Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.
 I went out full of good things and the LORD hath brought me back empty. Why then call ye me Naomi, since the LORD hath brought me low and and the Almighty hath afflicted me.8

How pure her features! Something sour
Yet charming played about her untamed lip;
She was indeed the daughter of the shore,
Strong, as if tempered by the exhalations of the sea.

The clock has struck the hour to leave! In front of the cottages stands a handsome young man, his traveller’s stick across his shoulder, a bag on his back. His glance, usually so bright, wanders slowly about him; his expression is calm, and everything about him seems to suggest great peace of mind; and yet his heart is beating fast, and his weighed-down bosom painfully rises and falls. His mother grips one of his hands and pours out upon him the signs of the most ardent affection; the poor woman does not weep; her cheeks tremble under the effort she makes to hide her sorrow. She smiles at her child to comfort him, but her smile, forced and pained, is sadder than the most heart-rending cries. The other widow is busy calming the little boy, and tries to convince him that Jean will come back soon; but the child has understood from the sadness that has overcome his family for the past year that separation is a terrible misfortune, and now he is crying loudly. Inside, the grandfather and Catherine are making the last preparations for the journey: they hollow out a rye loaf and fill it with butter. They go outside with the provisions for the journey and stand near the young man. The cowshed is open; the bull looks sadly at his master, and from time to time makes a soft, melancholy lowing; it is as if the animal understands what is about to happen. Everything is ready: he is about to leave. He has already squeezed his mother’s hand with a harder grip and taken a step forward; but he casts his gaze around him, casts an affectionate glance over the humble cottage that held his cradle, the heath and woods that witnessed his childhood and the arid fields so often watered with the sweat of his youth! Then his eye meets in turn the eyes of all those whom he loves, and those of that bull, too, companion of his hard labours; he covers his face with his hand, hides the tears that run down his cheeks, and says in a voice than can scarcely be understood: Farewell.
He raises his head, shakes the thick hair that falls over his neck like a mane, and steps firmly forward. But they all follow him; the moment of separation has not yet come. At a certain point on the way to the village, at the place where the roads cross, stands a lime tree, on which is hung an image of the Holy Virgin. Trine put it there on a beautiful May evening, and Jean made a prie-dieu of turf at the foot of the tree. It is in this holy place, where every day, one of them would come to thank and to praise God, that the heart-rending words of farewell will escape their trembling lips…
In the distance can already be seen the lime tree, the point at which the inevitable separation must begin. The young man slows his pace, while his mother, still lavishing caresses upon him, says: Jean, my son, never forget what I have told you. Always have God before your eyes, and never fail to say your prayers before you go to bed. As long as you do that, you will always be good; but if it should happen that one evening you forget to pray, think of me the next day, think of your mother, and you will be good and brave again; for the man who thinks of God and of his mother, is protected from all evil, my dear child.
I shall always, always, think of you, my mother, said the young man with a sigh, but in a calm voice; if I am sad, and I lose courage, your memory will be my support and my consolation; and I feel it, I shall be unhappy, I love you all too dearly. 
&nbsp;1v:2 
And then you mustn’t swear, you know, or lead a bad life. You’ll go to church, won’t you? You’ll give us news about your Health as often as possible, and you won’t forget that the smallest word from her child makes a mother happy, isn’t that so? Oh, I’ll say a prayer every day to your blessed guardian Angel, praying that he will never abandon you! Jean is deeply moved by his mother’s soft, penetrating voice; he dare not look at her, so much is he struck at this solemn moment by the worthy woman’s clear look: it is with bowed head that he listens. His only answer is from time to time a tighter handclasp, and a long sigh, with which now and then are mingled the words, Mother, dear Mother! They approached the crossroads in silence; the grandfather stood on the other side of the young man, and said to him in a grave voice: Jean, my boy, you’ll do your duty without reluctance and with love, won’t you? You’ll be obedient to your superiors, and you’ll put up with an injustice without complaining about it, if one should be done to you? You’ll be considerate and obliging to everyone, you’ll show you’re willing, and you’ll carry out courageously all the orders you’re given? Then God will help you, your officers and comrades will love you. Trine, his mother, and the little boy were already under the lime tree, praying on their knees on the turf bench. Jean had no time to reply to his grandfather’s recommendations; his Mother drew him towards the bench. They all knelt and prayed with hands raised to heaven.
The wind murmurs softly in the branches of the pines, the spring sunshine gilds the sandy road with its joyful rays, the birds sing their gay song; and yet a solemn silence reigns, for one can clearly hear the prayers rising from around the lime tree... It is done; they all rise, but from every eye falls a torrent of tears. The mother embraces her son while giving heart-rending cries, and though the others’ arms were already opened wide for the sad farewell embrace, she does not let her child go, she staunches with her kisses the tears that bathe his cheeks, and utters unintelligible words of anxiety and love, and she weeps on his shoulder.
At last, the poor woman, worn out, exhausted and still weeping, goes and sinks down on the bench. Jean hastily kisses his grandfather and Trine’s mother; he releases himself with gentle force from the embrace of his despairing little brother, runs back to his mother, presses her tightly in his arms, places a kiss on her forehead and shouts in an agonizing voice: Farewell!
And without daring to look back, he walks rapidly in the direction of the village, until at the corner of the wood, he has disappeared from his family’s sight.

Evening song.1

Oh play another song for me
Old man, honest and true,
Try and see if one sweet chord
Can move my heart anew.

The sick child prays, the old man plays
His song had never been so tender,
Nor, like now, so magical:
It filled him, too, with wonder.

There trills a chord so heavenly
It moves the old man’s heart.
The organ ss, the dear child’s soul
This earthly vale departs.
    
 A longing for sanctification2

Who shall free us fully and for ever
From the body of this death, bent beneath the yoke?
How long must I still combat my nature
Ere this heart from sinful service be revoked?

That God my God would be, I pledged my troth
With singleness of mind Him would I follow
But I was tried – forgotten was my oath
I was tempted – and my foot did falter.

No, with my own strength I shan’t learn to conquer
Soul, confess your weakness, self-deceit, take flight!
A child’s heart must be shaped by the Father
The Master be the pupil’s guiding light.
&nbsp;1v:2 

Well then, Father, let your love be my teacher
My Master, take my hand, and show your standard
I stood alone – and fell: now we’re together
I succumbed, but win behind your vanguard.

Only now do I feel strong, when with weakness stricken
Powerless in myself, but in the Lord, almighty!
Sin may tempt, the evil passions quicken,
Thou castest down all foes, O God in me!

I am grieved, but it’s a godly sadness
A night-cloud – tinged all round with dawn’s bright crimson
I weep, Lord, though my heart is full of gladness
I bow my head – but, Father, in thy bosom.


I know in Whom my faith is founded,
Though day and night change constantly,
I know the rock on which I’m grounded,
My Saviour waits, unfailingly.
When once life’s evening overcomes me,
Worn down by ills and strife always,
For every day Thou hast allowed me,
I’ll bring Thee higher, purer praise.3


&nbsp;2r:3 
    The pilgrimage4

Homesickness flowed through
The heart of a pilgrim,
Seeking the heavenly
Jerusalem.
City of pleasures,
Of joy everlasting,
Which once God’s angel
Had promised to him.

Crystal-clear rivers,
May your placid waters
Show the reflection
Of this lovely sight.
Glittering mountains,
From far you behold it,
The place that my soul
Doth ease and invite. 

I hear there the chiming
Of bells as though ringing.
The sunset suffuses
The woods with its glow.
If I only had wings
Like a dove I should glide,
And fly fast through the sky, To you, city, I’d go.

Sanctified wistfulness Softens my spirit,
And vehement yearnings
Rise up from my heart.
With weariness sinking
On his bed of flowers,
He gazes with longing
On those distant parts.

Wide, oh too wide
Is the distance between us.
Long is the journey,
I am overwhelmed.
Dreams of enchantment
Unveil the delightfulness, Give me the joys
Of the heavenly realm.

Looming vault
Now opens: an Angel,
Shining like silver,
Doth kindly descend,
Speaking thus: Would God Deny you the power?
He who before made you
Yearn without end? 

Silent delights and the
sweetest illusions,
May weaklings derive from them
True nourishment.
Perpetual striving
Is manly and noble.
It leads to the target,
Makes real the pretence.

Sweet as the fragrance
Of flowers he vanishes,
Up springs the pilgrim
Made strong by his words.
He wanders down difficult Paths with great courage
Till, dazzling, the heavenly gates
Do emerge.

It opens its wings
Like the arms of the Mother, Who longs for her son And his advent attends.
Jubilant singing
Greets the ears of the weary,
As bravely his journey
Is brought to an end.

Pious parents are a blessing,
Child, you can’t thank them enough!
They pave for you the straight and narrow
Path, which many find so tough.5

Oh the skylark ever chirping
On thy nimble wings now circling
Flying higher in the sky.
Singing hymns let us unite
Rising in the glorious light
Freed from fetters now am I.6

&nbsp;2v:4 
The king on the tower platform7

The hills lie ayonder
All misty and grey
The valleys are sunken
In nocturnal shade.

All round me is slumber
Not one sign of woe
Is brought to disturb me
By breezes that blow.

I’ve ever looked after
Each one’s happiness
I’ve drunk of the cup
In both need and distress.

The night time has fallen
The firmament glows
I long for the peace that
Most pleases my soul.

O glimmering starlight
The Writ from on high
With love you attract me
And capture my eye.

Rapturous music
Of heavenly choirs
Scarce heard, yet caressing
And soothing my ears.

My hair’s turning grey now
My ardour doth pall
My armour now hangs
Full of rust on the wall.

Justly I’ve spoken, And justice I’ve done
Oh when will my hour
Of peace finally come?

The peace which my spirit
Doth crave with all might
Abide now no longer
O most blessed night!

May I gaze upon stars Which more wonderfully glow,
And be able to hear sounds
Much louder than now.
    
Winter morning8

’Twas a cheerless winter morn
Of sunlight not a glimmer.
At intervals a death-knell rang
And pierced the misty shimmer.

How dull it sounded, that one bell,
Given a brief ringing,
But soon one heard a hoarse voice raised
To sing a song of mourning.

It was a destitute old man
They carried to his grave.
His burial was as grim and drab
As once had been his days.

Now he’s in God’s glorious light,
The choirs of angels sing.
Rejoicing now, their fulsome tones
Throughout the world shall ring.
    
The larks9

Welcome sight of larks ascending,
Skyward paths forever wending,
Some alight beside the stream,
Others frolic in the tree.
To sing God’s praise is the delight
Of one who from my heart takes flight!
    
Cemetery in spring10

Resting place of our departed,
Don the festive dress of spring.
Hide thyself behind rose-petals,
Green grass be thy covering.
Close the gate and all thorn-hedges,
Open up thy tombs for me.
Very well then, I am ready,
Even though this vernal splendour
Urges me to labour further.
    
Evening clouds11

Clouds during the day so dark
In the western sky do hover,
Glowing with a purple shimmer
Pierced by sunsets’ golden light.

In like way, foretells my heart,
Soon or late, when I, death-stricken,
Leave this life, my soul will quicken
And what now is dark make bright.top

Be of good courage, and He shall strengthen thine heart.1 Behold, Satan hath desired to have our soul, that he may sift us as wheat.2 And the end shall not be yet.3

1 Cor XI:23. For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which He was betrayed took bread: and when He had given thanks, He brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of Me. After the same manner also He took the cup, when He had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in My blood, which is shed for you for the remission of sins,4 this do ye, as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, in remembrance of Me, and do shew the Lord’s death till he come.5

Luke XXII. And He came out, and went, as He was wont, to the mount of Olives; and His disciples also followed Him. And when He was at the place, He said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation. And he was withdrawn from them about a stone’s cast, and kneeled down, and prayed, saying, Father! if Thou be willing, remove this cup from Me! nevertheless not My will, but Thy will, be done. And there appeared an angel unto Him, strengthening Him. And being in an agony He prayed more earnestly: and His sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground. And when He rose up from prayer, and was come to His disciples, He found them sleeping for sorrow.6

Then Pilate questioned Him in many words,7 but He answered him nothing. And Pilate saith, Knowest Thou not that I have power to crucify Thee, and have power to release Thee? And Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against Me, except it were given thee from Above.8

Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man.9

Scheveningen.1
Holland’s coasts are hidden by ranges of dunes that deprive the traveller of the sight of the waters. After a long and arduous climb up these sandy hills, raise your eyes, and there’s the sea! This North Sea was poorly known to the ancients, who imagined it in terms of fables and superstitious terrors. Even Tacitus pictured it as being churned up by constant winds and inhabited by monsters. The fact is that its coasts are stormy, and its colour is variable; in the foreground it is a scummy yellow that looks like dirty washing water, further off, a weak green, and in the distance, a faded blue that blends into the wavy line of the sky. Here and there, great clouds cast their sombre shadows obliquely over this indistinct mirror. No rocks, no cliffs break the force of the waves: this sea rolls on its sandy bed, which it had made for itself and which it is constantly expanding. The physiognomy of Holland’s coasts varies very little: sand, and more sand, water and more water, sky and more sky. On these coasts, which give the impression of being limitless, there stand, between the mouth of the Maas and Den Helder, a number of fishing villages. The most interesting of these villages is Scheveningen. The beach at Scheveningen is frequented by bathers during the summer. At that time of year, a pretty village, linked with The Hague by a tree-lined road, and a promenade built of timber that disappears among the dunes, welcomes foreigners from every country. Here everything shows the effects of proximity to the Ocean. The church, which by no means lacks elegance, contains the enormous skull and a few vertebrae of a sperm whale that was cast up on the shore in a storm, in 1617. These silent fragments are like a commentary on these words of Job: “The monsters proclaim Thee, O Lord”. In the main street, which leads to the sea, are to be found several vendors of shellfish. This sea, whose voice can be heard, shows itself only when the traveller’s feet are almost at the water. The sudden delight of surprise, and the grandeur of the scene that then opens up, fully compensate for the gradation of effects found on other shores. A fishing fleet, whose smacks are beached on the sand, or riding at anchor, or scattered out at sea like the thoughts of the sea’s brain, associates the image of labour with historical memories. Here the Ocean must be proud of Holland and the Dutch; in 1673, De Ruyter defeated the English and French fleets within sight of Scheveningen.
&nbsp;1v:2  This little village is Holland’s Cherbourg. It has seen exiles and royal misfortunes. It was a cold January day in 1795; the fishermen were loading two boats with packages and travelling trunks; from a conveyance that appeared at the far end of the village came a man enveloped in a wide cloak and a woman carrying a child in her arms. That man was the Prince of Orange; the child was the grandson of the last Stadholder, the future King William II. In 1813, this shore once again saw and welcomed amid acclamations (the Empire had just fallen) the representative of that same family that now occupies the throne of the Netherlands.
If you continue your walk along the sands to the right you will find the spa hotel, where people from The Hague come on Sunday evenings to listen to music. At nightfall, when the sea steals from the sky all its stars, it is a solemn and magnificent prospect. I have seen, in front of this hotel, a display of fireworks on the water, whose subject was, of course, the burning of a ship. I am not especially fond of rockets or Roman candles, but in this case the vulgarity of such entertainments was redeemed by its theatrical grandeur. The darkling sea was almost in itself worth the whole cost of the performance, and with its sublime din, with those tattered clouds, with the only too real catastrophes which the imagination could picture to itself in this pretended conflagration, the scene by no means lacked majesty. And yet this main street, these baths, these cafés, these hotels – all of that is not Scheveningen. A person may have spent many summers in this place and yet not know the fishing village at all. Behind some elegant dwellings, which are a true example of trompe l’oeil, are hidden narrow streets, and poor brick hovels, in which a silent and wretched population conceals itself. At the doors of these poky cubby-holes, in front of which are drying washing, nets, red shirts and strings of fish threaded on a line, there appears from time to time the figure of a woman, sad, aged and wasted by fever. Children play in the midst of all this wretchedness, as if it were one of the privileges of their age to be unaware of misfortune and poverty. The population of Scheveningen is 6,800, of whom only 450 are Catholics. It should be noted that the majority of the innkeepers and fish merchants profess the Catholic faith, whereas the shipowners and the fishermen are Protestants. For the village there are two government schools, which we visited and which are kept in perfect order. The first, if truth be told, is a ward in an asylum, which holds 250 children of both sexes. 
&nbsp;1v:3  The children leave this first school at the age of about six, and then enter the primary school, which has 500 pupils. Teaching is shared among a head, five assistant masters and five monitors. The children are taught reading, writing, arithmetic, geography and a little history. They leave this second school at between ten and twelve years of age: the boats claim them. The fishermen’s language is a kind of patois that is fundamentally different from ordinary Dutch, and in which some linguists have believed they recognize traces of the Anglo-Saxon that seems to have been the source of the national language. Their dress, especially the women’s, is distinctive. In the winter, they wear a bodice of serge or calico, a brown serge skirt, a long cape of the same stuff and the same colour, lined in red, with a tall, stiff collar. There is something austere and monkish about this form of clothing; one must in any case admit that it is well suited to the climate and to their occupation. A large hat of coarse straw with a border of black ribbon, lined in flower-printed calico, bent slightly downward on either side and rising at the back and the front like a boat, enables them to hold up to three or four baskets on their heads. These women are tall, and robustly built, with rather plain but healthy-looking faces, blue eyes with somewhat drooping lids, and sturdy limbs. By the age of thirty they have already lost much of their freshness; their skin is weather-beaten, a condition due, no doubt, to the proximity of the sea and to their living in the dunes. The dunes form a country within the country itself; the sand reflects the sun’s rays more strongly than elsewhere; this is Holland’s Arabia. 
The men are comparatively short in stature; their dress – black jacket and trousers – does not suit their bearing, which is serious, but awkward. They have round faces, short necks, usually brown and curly hair. Their great treasures are their shirt-buttons and the silver buckles which they attach to their feet and their belts. This conservatism in their dress, especially the women’s, this consistency in their physical traits, these racial characteristics that are preserved due to the concern shown by the boys and girls of Scheveningen to marry only amongst themselves, are all, perhaps, a consequence of their dealings with the sea. The Ocean, in which some poets have believed they have seen an image of inconstancy, is, on the contrary, an image of eternity; of all the elements, it is the one that has suffered the fewest vicissitudes since the beginning of the world. 
&nbsp;1r:4 
The dawn of creation saw it born thus, and thus it still rolls today. It moves, it does not change. The Ocean sets its ever-moving stability against the forces of time that undermine the rocks, that alter the level of the continents, that transform living nature and human destinies. The ways of the fishermen who live on the coast share the nature of the Ocean. They have none of the habits of the city. The essence of their character is independence.2 It seems that dealings with the sea foster in them the sense of human dignity. These men have no love of the land; they need space, the free vastness of the seas, the untamed flood, the sky, blue by day, full of stars by night, the sharp north wind, the mind of a man standing upright in his actions like the ship’s mast upon the movements of the Ocean. Soldiers of toil, they love deliberately to brave the lightning’s bolt, the whinnying of the waves that run, without a bit and foaming at the mouth, about the boat’s keel. On land, they are homesick. Strangers to social conventions, they wish to be neither governed nor protected. This feeling of independence can be seen on their faces. Sailors and fishermen differ from other men in the way they carry their heads high as they walk. One would at the very least say that for them was written Ovid’s line:3 He gave man a face that looks at the sky.
This love of liberty even rubs off on their religious beliefs. As we have seen, all, or almost all, of the fishermen of the coast are Protestant; they acknowledge only two books that have the right to speak to them of God: the Bible and the sea. It appears that the Ocean exerts a moral and sanctifying effect on them. Drunkenness is rare among the fishermen of Scheveningen, but even those who drink Hollands gin to excess on land abstain from any form of intemperance when they are at sea. Swearing is unknown on board a boat. The seafaring life strengthens and increases religious feelings in these simple and ignorant men. When a fishing boat sails, each fisherman takes his Bible with him. A meal is never eaten without grace being said, and is also followed by a prayer of thanks. On Sunday, if the men are at sea, they abstain from fishing, and if they are on land, the singing of the Psalms can be heard in their little houses from morning onwards.

St Jerome’s love.1

Who is the maid my spirit seeks
Through cold reproof, and slanders blight –
Has she loves roses on her cheeks?
Is her’s an eye of calm delight?
No – wan and sunk with midnight prayer
Are the pale looks of her I love
And if by times a light be there
That light is kindled from above.

I choose not her mine hearts elect
’Mongst those that seek their Makers shrine
In gems and garlands proudly decked
As if themselves were things divine.
No, heaven but faintly warms the breast
That beats beneath a broidered veil.
And she, who comes in glittering dress
To mourn her frailty – yet is frail.

Not so the faded form I prize
And love because her bloom is gone
The glory of those sainted eyes
Is all the dress her brow puts on.
But ne’er was beauties bloom so bright,
So touching as that forms decay
Which as the altars wavering light
In holy lustre fades away.

Have you been working in the country lately and is the house you are building getting on?
    It appears that Claude Monet has done fine things, my brothers writes to say that he has at present an exhibition of 10 new pictures. One representing pinetrees by the seaside with a red sunset casting a red glow over stems, branches, foliage and the ground itself — a marvel I hear.1

My dear friend,
Please write to my brother that he should maintain the prices for your paintings rather than offering them for less.1
It’s no easier to sell them if they’re cheaper, nor is it more difficult to sell them for more, take my word for it, if you can sell them at all.
I hadn’t wanted to write you about this, preferring instead to talk to you at length about it.
I’m very busy at the moment: I’m working on half a dozen canvases of 30 square, to be used to decorate the house. There are three canvases of the public garden,2 4. ploughed fields3 [x] [the starry night [?]]4

exaggerated in the work. That parents who are ignorant from the point of view of painting should s loving a child who’s a little different from the rest – that’s certainly a terrible misunderstanding – but even if they understood painting, how could one reproach them for it too much in this society of money and military men? That’s why, if he did his military service,1 it wouldn’t be more unfortunate for him, it would be to admit in good time that one has been vanquished by fate. What became of Vignon?2
Anyway, this is certain, it’s not a matter of putting on a proud front or having great hopes for what comes next. Let’s take the terrible realities as they are, and if I have to abandon painting I think I shall. In any case, I really want to see, one more time and with better health than two years ago, if I can’t find some sort of position. I’ve often told myself that if, two years ago, I’d had a calmer temperament like Seurat, for example, I could have resisted.

Who is the maid my spirit seeks3
Through cold reproof and slanders blight
Has she loves roses on her cheeks
Is hers an eye of calm delight?
No, wan and sunk with midnight prayer
As the worn looks of her I love
And if by chance a light be there
As fire was kindled from above
I choose not her mine hearts elect
Amongst those who seek their makers’ shrine
In gems and garlands proudly decked
As if themselves were things divine
And they who come in glittering dress
To mourn their frailty yet are frail
No heaven but faintly warm the breast
That beats beneath a broidered veil.
Not so the form of her I love
And... because her bloom is gone
But ne’er was beauty’s bloom so bright
So touching as that forms decay
That like the altars wavering light

My dear sister,
For a few days now I would have liked to reply to your kind letter, which I received while still in St-Rémy. Things weren’t working out there any more, and I was becoming rather iller through the treatment.
In Paris it was a great joy for me to see Theo again and to meet Jo and the little one. Jo made an excellent impression upon me, she’s charming and very simple and good. Yes it really seems to me to be going as well as possible for the moment.
And as for myself, for the moment I still fear the noise and the bustle of Paris and I left immediately for the country – to an old village.
Here there are roofs of mossy thatch which are superb, and of which I’ll certainly do something. 
&nbsp;1v:2 
Then I think that the doctor to whom I’ve been recommended1 will absolutely let me be as if nothing were wrong.
In the last few days at St-Rémy I worked in a frenzy. Big bouquets of flowers, violet irises,2 big bouquets of roses.3 Landscapes.4
It was odd to see all my canvases from the beginning again, from the time I left.
But I would very much have liked you to have seen the olive groves that I’ve brought with me now, with yellow, pink, blue skies, quite different, I think that these are canvases that haven’t yet been painted like this.5 Up to now the others always painted them in grey. 
&nbsp;1v:3 
I was very pleased to see the exhibition at the Champ de Mars,6 where there are many things I like a lot.
","-------------------------20 = 
 
My dear Theo and dear Jo.
In normal circumstances I would certainly have already hoped for a brief line from you in these early days. But considering things as faits accomplis – my word – I think that Theo, Jo and the little one are a little on edge and worn out – besides, I too am far from having arrived at some kind of tranquillity. Often, very often, I think of my little nephew – is he well? Jo will you believe me – if you again happen to have more children, which I hope, don’t have them in town, give birth in the country and stay there until the child is 3 or 4 months old. At present – it seems to me that although the child is no more than 3 months old yet, the milk is already becoming sparse, already you’re like Theo, too tired.
I don’t at all want to say exhausted, but anyway troubles are taking up too much room, are too numerous, and you’re sowing among thorns.1 That’s why I’d have you consider not going to Holland this year, the journey is always very, very costly and it has never done any good. Well yes, it does Mother good, if you like, as she’ll love to see the little one – but she’ll understand and will prefer the little one’s well-being to the pleasure of seeing him. Besides, she won’t lose anything by it, she’ll see him later. But – without daring to say that it might be enough – whatever the case it’s certainly preferable that father, mother and child take an absolute rest in the country for a month.
On the other hand, I too greatly fear being confused – and find it strange that I shouldn’t know at all under what conditions I left – if it’s as before at 150 a month in three instalments – Theo didn’t arrange anything, and so to begin with I left in confusion.2 
&nbsp;1v:2 
Would there be a way of seeing each other again more calmly – I hope so. But the journey to Holland, I fear that it would be the last straw for all of us.
I still foresee that it makes the child suffer later to be brought up in town. Does Jo consider that an exaggeration? I hope so, but anyway I believe that one must be prudent, though. And I say what I think because you well understand that I take an interest in my little nephew and care about his well-being; since you really wanted to name him after me, I’d wish him to have a less anxious soul than mine. Which is foundering.
Let’s talk now about Dr Gachet. I went to see him the day before yesterday, I didn’t find him.
I’ve been very well the past few days, I’m working hard and have four painted studies and two drawings.3
You’ll see a drawing of an old vineyard with a figure of a peasant woman. I’m planning to do a large canvas of it.
I think that we must in no way count on Dr Gachet. In the first place he’s iller than I am, it seemed to me, or let’s say just as much, there you have it. Now when one blind man leads another blind man, do they not both fall into the ditch?4
I don’t know what to say. Certainly my last crisis, which was terrible, was due in considerable part to the influence of the other patients,5 anyway, the prison was crushing me, and père Peyron didn’t pay the slightest attention to it, leaving me to vegetate with the rest, who were profoundly corrupted. 
&nbsp;1v:3 
I can have lodgings, 3 small rooms at 150 a year. This if I don’t find better, and I hope to find better, is in any case preferable to the bedbug-infested hole at Tanguy’s,6 and besides I’d find a shelter myself there and could retouch the canvases that need it. In such a way the paintings will be less spoiled, and by keeping them in order the chance of deriving some profit from them would increase. For – I’m not talking about my own – but the Bernard, Prévost,7 Russell, Guillaumin, Jeannin canvases that ended up there – that’s not the place for them.8
Now canvases like those – once again I’m not talking about my own – are merchandise which has and will retain a certain value, and neglecting it is one of the causes of our mutual financial embarrassment.
It rather saddens me to have to insist that you send me at least part of my month right at the beginning. But I’ll still do all I can to ensure that all goes well.
It’s certain, I think, that we’re all thinking of the little one, and Jo must just say what she wants, I dare believe that Theo, like me, will go along with her opinion. Myself, all I can do at the moment is say that I think that we all need some rest. I feel – a failure – that’s it as regards me – I feel that that’s the fate I’m accepting. And which won’t change any more. But one more reason, setting aside all ambition, we can live together for years without ruining ourselves on either side. You see that with the canvases that are still in St-Rémy – there are at least 8 of them9 – and with the 4 from here, I’m trying not to lose my touch. That, though, is the absolute 
&nbsp;1r:4  truth, it’s difficult to acquire a certain facility of production, and by ceasing to work I would lose it much more quickly, more easily than it cost me in troubles to acquire it. And the prospect darkens, I don’t see a happy future at all.
Write to me by return of post if you haven’t already written, and good handshakes in thought, I would hope that it might be possible to see each other soon with more rested minds.

Vincent.

My dear Mr Isaäcson,
      On returning to Paris I read the continuation of your articles on the Impressionists.1 Without wanting to get into a discussion on the details of the subject you have broached, it seems to me that you are conscientiously trying to tell our fellow-countrymen how matters stand, basing yourself on facts. Since perhaps you will also say a few words about me in your next article I would repeat my scruples, so that you say just only a few words, as I am decidedly certain that I shall never do important things.2 Although I believe in the possibility that a later generation will again and always be concerned with a continuation of interesting researches into colour and modern sentiment, parallel, equivalent to those of Delacroix, Puvis de Chavannes – and that Impressionism will be the source of it, if you like – and that the Dutch of the future will also be engaged in this struggle – all this is in the realm of the possible, and your articles certainly have their raison d’être.
But I was going to wander off into vagueness – this is the why of this letter – I wanted to inform you that in the last part of my stay in the south I tried to capture a few olive groves. You are not unaware of the existing paintings of olive trees. I think it likely that there must be some in the work of Claude Monet and Renoir. But apart from this – and although I assume this exists I have not seen any of it – apart from this, what people do of olive trees is very little. 
&nbsp;1v:2 
Well, the day is probably not far off when people will paint the olive tree in every way as they have painted the willow and the Dutch pollard willow, as they have painted the Norman apple tree since Daubigny and César de Cock.3 The effect of daylight, of the sky, means that there is an infinity of subjects to be drawn from the olive tree. Now I looked for some effects of opposition between the changing foliage and the tones of the sky. Sometimes the whole thing is wrapped in pure blue at the time when the tree bears pale blossoms and the numerous big blue flies, the emerald rose beetles, finally the cicadas, fly around it.4 Then, when the more bronzed greenery takes on riper tones the sky is resplendent and is striped with green and orange;5 or even further on in the autumn, the leaves take on the violet tones vaguely of a ripe fig, the violet effect will be displayed in full by the oppositions of the large whitening sun in a halo of clear, fading lemon.6 Sometimes, too, after a shower, I have seen all the sky coloured in pink and bright orange, which gave an exquisite value and coloration to the silvery greenish greys. In there, there were women, also pink, who were picking the fruit.7
These canvases, with a few studies of flowers, that is all I have done since our last correspondence. These flowers are an avalanche of roses against a green background,8 and a very large bouquet of violet Irises against yellow background, against pink background.9
I am increasingly beginning to feel that one may consider Puvis de Chavannes as having the importance of Delacroix, anyway that he has equal worth with the people whose genius attains a thus-far-and-no-further, forever consoling. 
&nbsp;1v:3  His canvas currently at the Champ de Mars, among others, appears to allude to an equivalence, to a strange and providential meeting of the very distant antiquities and raw modernity.10 Even more vague, more prophetic than the Delacroixs if possible, one feels moved before his canvases of recent years as though present at a continuation of all things, an inevitable but benevolent rebirth. But it is as well not to press the point on this subject when one is meditating gratefully before a painting as definitive as the sermon on the mount.11 Ah, He would do the olive trees of the south, He the seer. Myself, I tell you as a friend, before such a nature I feel powerless, my northern brain having been seized by a nightmare in these peaceful places, because I felt one must be better to do it. However, I did not want to remain completely without attempting an effort but it is limited to naming these two things — the cypresses – the olive trees. Let others better and more powerful than me express their symbolic language. Millet is the voice of the wheat, and Jules Breton also. Now I assure you, I can no longer think of Puvis de Chavannes without having a presentiment that one day perhaps he or another will explain the olive trees to us.
Myself, I can see from afar the possibility of a new painting but it was too much for me, and it is with pleasure that I return to the north.
See here, the question presents itself to my mind thus. Who are the human beings who currently inhabit the groves of olive trees, of oranges, of lemons? The peasant from there is a different thing from the inhabitant of the great wheatfields of Millet. But Millet reopened our thoughts to see the inhabitant of nature. But no one has yet 
&nbsp;1r:4  painted for us the current human being of the south. But when Chavannes or someone else shows us this human being, these old words will come back to us with a new meaning, blessed are the poor in spirit, blessed are the pure in heart,12 words of such impact that those of us brought up in the old towns of the north, confused and defeated, must halt a long way from the threshold of these dwellings. Then, however convinced we may be by Rembrandt’s vision, yet one asks oneself: and did Raphael want this, and Michelangelo and Da Vinci? I do not know, but I believe that Giotto, less pagan, felt it more, that great sickly fellow13 who remains as familiar as a contemporary.

Monday
Regards to Maître Van Gogh
from his devoted
Dr Gachet
","-------------------------23 = 
 
My dear friend Gauguin
      Thanks for writing to me again,1 my dear friend, and be assured that since my return I’ve thought about you every day. I only stayed in Paris for three days, and as the Parisian noise &amp;c. made a pretty bad impression on me I judged it wise for my head to clear off to the countryside – otherwise I would have swiftly run round to your place. And it gives me enormous pleasure that you say that you liked the portrait of the Arlésienne based rigorously on your drawing.2 I tried to be respectfully faithful to your drawing while taking the liberty of interpreting through the medium of a colour the sober character and the style of the drawing in question.
It’s a synthesis of an Arlésienne if you like, as syntheses of Arlésiennes are rare, take it as a work by you and me, like a summary of our months of work together. To do it I, for my part, paid with another month of illness,3 but I also know that it’s a canvas that will be understood by you, me and just one or two others, as we’d like it to be understood. Here my friend Dr Gachet came to it completely after two, three hesitations and says: ‘how difficult it is to be simple’. Right – I’m going to emphasize the thing even more by etching it, that thing, then that’s enough. Whoever wants it can have it.4 
&nbsp;1v:2 
Have you also seen the olive trees? Now I have a portrait of Dr Gachet with the deeply sad expression of our time.5 If you like something like you were saying about your Christ in the Garden of Olives, not destined to be understood,6 but anyhow up to that point I follow you, and my brother clearly grasps this nuance.
I also have a cypress with a star from down there.

[sketch A]

A last try – a night sky with a moon without brightness, the slender crescent barely emerging from the opaque projected shadow of the earth – a star with exaggerated brightness, if you like, a soft brightness of pink and green in the ultramarine sky where clouds run. Below, a road bordered by tall yellow canes behind which are the blue low Alpilles, an old inn with orange lighted windows and a very tall cypress, very straight, very dark.
On the road a yellow carriage harnessed to a white horse, and two late walkers.7 Very romantic if you like, but also ‘Provençal’ I think. I’ll probably make etchings of this one, and of other landscapes and subjects, reminiscences of Provence, then I’ll look forward to giving you an ensemble, a rather deliberate and studied summary. My brother says that Lauzet, who’s doing the lithographs after Monticelli, liked that head of the Arlésienne.8 
&nbsp;1v:3 
So you’ll understand that having arrived in Paris a little confused I haven’t yet seen any of your canvases. But soon I hope to return there for a few days. Very pleased to learn from your letter that you’re returning to Brittany with De Haan. It’s highly likely that – if you allow me – I’ll come for a month to join you there to do a seascape or two, but especially to see you and make the acquaintance of De Haan. Then we’ll try to do something deliberate and serious, as it would probably have become if we’d been able to continue down there.
Look, an idea which will perhaps suit you. I’m trying to do studies of wheat like this, however I can’t draw it –

[sketch B]

nothing but ears, blue-green stems, long leaves like ribbons, green and pink by reflection, yellowing ears lightly bordered with pale pink due to the dusty flowering. A pink bindweed at the bottom wound around a stem. On it, on a very alive and yet tranquil background, I would like to paint portraits. It is greens of different quality, of the same value, in such a way as to form a green whole which would by its vibration make one think of the soft sound of the ears swaying in the breeze.9 It’s not at all easy as a colour scheme.

[sketch C]

Dear brother and sister,
My impression is that as we’re all a little dazed, and moreover all working quite hard, it’s relatively unimportant to insist on having very clear-cut definitions of the position in which we find ourselves.1 You surprise me a little, seeming to want to force the situation, being in disagreement. 
&nbsp;1v:2 
Can I do anything about it – perhaps not – but have I done something wrong, or anyway can I do something or other that you would like?
Whatever the case, again a good handshake in thought – and it nevertheless gave me a lot of pleasure to see you all again.2 Be very much assured of that.

Yours truly,
V.

My dear brother,
Thanks for your kind letter and for the 50-franc note it contained.
I’d really like to write to you about many things, but I sense the pointlessness of it.
I hope that you’ll have found those gentlemen favourably disposed towards you.1
You didn’t need to reassure me as to the state of peace of your household. I believe I’ve seen the good as much as the other side. And besides, am so much in agreement that raising a kid in a fourth floor apartment is hard labour, as much for you as for Jo. Since that’s going well, which is the main thing, should I go on about things of lesser importance? My word, there’s probably a long way to go before there’s a chance of talking business with more rested minds. That’s the only thing I can say at the moment, and that for my part I realized it with a certain horror, I haven’t yet hidden it, but that really is all.
&nbsp;1v:2 
The other painters, whatever they think about it, instinctively keep their distance from discussions on current trade. Ah well, really we can only make our paintings speak.
    But however, my dear brother, there’s this that I’ve always told you, and I tell you again once more with all the gravity that can be imparted by the efforts of thought assiduously fixed on trying to do as well as one can – I tell you again that I’ll always consider that you’re something other than a simple dealer in Corots,2 that through my intermediacy you have your part in the very production of certain canvases, which even in calamity retain their calm. For that’s where we are, and that’s all, or at least the main thing I can have to tell you in a moment of relative crisis. In a moment when things are very tense between dealers in paintings – by dead artists – and living artists.
Ah well, I risk my life for my own work and my reason has half foundered in it – very well – 
&nbsp;1v:3  but you’re not one of the dealers in men; as far as I know and can judge I think you really act with humanity, but what can you do
